    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The general concept of a product model, for example, Ford T. The instances of this class are not specific instances of the product - the latter are just instances. Although product models are rather abstract entities (generally, intangible), this class is defined as a sub-class of Object, because it has a strong temporal extent (it comes to exsitence at some point of time). There could be several information resources associated with a product model (e.g. specifications, brouchures, etc.), but it is not an information resource on its own.</rdfs:comment>

A TimeInterval could collapse, in very special cases, to a time point, however in this case, in contrast to the Abstract time point (referring to some time during the day), it should be bound to a specific date, i.e. to represent a timestamp.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Determines whether a particular Agent is a legal entity. The range should be constrained to Boolean. Agents, for which the value is True, correspond to instances of http://www.cyc.com/2003/04/01/cyc#LegalAgent, which is defined as follows "Each instance of #LegalAgent is an agent who has some status in a particular legal system. At the very least, such an agent is recognized by some legal authority as having some kinds of rights and/or responsibilities as an agent (e.g., #citizens of Germany), ... ". In PROTON, it is modeled as property in order to avoid multiple-inheritance of classes and/or multiple classifications of instances.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#InformationResource"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and includes (among others) dates of the form YYYY-MM-DD. For official documents, it could be the date of signature. It can also contain a java timestamp. Usually, time is connected to a happening (event/situation) in which the information resource is a participation entity. These include: creation of the information resource, its modification or other important happening. Very often such happening is in the background knowledge and the modeling of domain task does not require the explicit representation of this happening. If it plays important role in the model domain or for the task, then the user needs to extend the ontology in an appropriate way.</rdfs:comment>
