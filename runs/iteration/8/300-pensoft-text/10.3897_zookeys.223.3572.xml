            <title>Introduction </title>
            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. (2012)</xref> recently opined that phenotype data collected by taxonomists, i.e., the natural language character statements found in diagnoses and descriptions, could, if presented in a broadly accessible, searchable manner, be used to address big questions in biology. Other components of the taxonomic process – names, specimens, DNA sequences, images, etc. – are already digitized and therefore contribute to discoveries in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Patterson et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Padial et al. 2010</xref>). Here we offer a real example of natural language descriptions that are annotated with semantic phenotype statements, modeled after the EQ representation referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. (2012)</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Mikó and Deans 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Mungall et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Mabee et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Patterson et al. 2010</xref>; Balhoff et al. in prep), expressed in Web Ontology Language (OWL) and therefore ready for the Semantic Web. A formal model has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Balhoff et al. 2011</xref>), and its advantages and limitations are discussed by Balhoff et al. (in prep).</p>
            <p>Our taxonomic subject is the ensign wasp genus, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> (<tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera </tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name>). Ensign wasps develop as solitary predators within cockroach egg cases (<tp:taxon-name>Dictyoptera </tp:taxon-name>: Blattodea). The family is common across the world except in polar regions, and species diversity is highest in the Neotropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Deans 2005</xref>). There are 21 extant genera and 580 described species of <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name> in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Deans 2005</xref>; Kawada 2012); ten genera of fossil evaniids are also known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Deans 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Peñalver et al. 2010</xref>). There is a paucity of prey records for <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name> in general, and none is known for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Deans 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> Szépligeti, 1903 is a relatively small genus of New World ensign wasps with four previously known, rarely collected species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>). The genus belongs to a New World clade that exhibits reduced wing venation, along with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semaeomyia </tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hyptia </tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Decevania </tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rothevania </tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Deans et al. 2006</xref>). Originally described by Szépligeti in 1903 for an unusual species from Venezuela, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic>, the genus has not been previously revised. Only two other New World evaniid lineages, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Alobevania </tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Decevania </tp:taxon-name></italic>, have undergone revision recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Deans and Kawada 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kawada and Azevedo 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kawada 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben (2003)</xref> diagnosed <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> by the following characters: “RS+M vein missing in the fore wing, coxae evenly-spaced, head hemispherical in lateral view, antennae 13-segmented and arising mid-height on the head, and metasoma ovoid”. In addition to the type species, three other species are currently included within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic>: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus marginatus </tp:taxon-name></italic> (Cameron, 1887), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> Enderlein, 1905, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus sulcigenis </tp:taxon-name></italic> Roman, 1917.</p>
            <p>Two hundred-fifty years of ensign wasp taxonomy has thus far yielded a corpus of species descriptions that lack utility beyond the realm of descriptive taxonomy (and even very little utility within this domain, as descriptions are usually short and lexically cryptic). For almost all <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name>, identification of species must be done by direct comparison with type specimens since there is a shortage of useable species descriptions or identification keys.</p>
            <p>The three primary goals of this paper are to 1) provide diagnostic characters for the identification of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species as well as a phylogeny, annotated images, and distribution records for species (i.e., a robust taxonomic revision), 2) apply new descri <!--PageBreak-->ptive methods, whereby annotations are composed from multiple ontologies to form semantic phenotype statements (a formal extension of methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Mikó and Deans 2009</xref>) and 3) assess the utility of free, online collaborative tools for use in descriptive taxonomy (an extension of methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Deans and Kawada 2008</xref>).</p>

            <p><italic>Collaborative environment </italic>. We used many accessible, free tools that have potential to help accelerate the publication of a manuscript. Since the authors were separated by physical distance, we used tools disseminated through the World Wide Web, such as online text editors (e.g. Google docs), Google draw, and Flickr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flickr.com">http://flickr.com </ext-link> ) that allowed for immediate and efficient communication. Matrix-based species descriptions were generated from mx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Yoder et al. 2006</xref>), a free, open-source software program for systematic biologists, which is designed to store various specimen metadata and to export the data as free text (in the format of “Character: Character state(s)”) and as input files that can be used in other applications.</p>
            <p><italic>Characters </italic>. Characters were described in natural language and then annotated with formalized entity-quality (EQ) statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Washington et al. 2009</xref>), where an anatomical structure is an entity and a phenotype descriptor represents a quality. EQ statements were composed using the following ontologies available through the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry: <tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera </tp:taxon-name> Anatomy Ontology (HAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Yoder et al. 2010</xref>) version <italic>&lt;</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hao/2012-05-03/hao.owl">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hao/2012-05-03/hao.owl </ext-link> <italic>&gt;</italic>, Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Mungall et al. 2010</xref>) version &lt; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/2012-05-09/pato.owl&gt;">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/2012-05-09/pato.owl&gt;</ext-link> , Relation Ontology (RO) (07/11/2012, 8:58 &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl&gt;">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl&gt;</ext-link> ) and Spatial Ontology (BSPO) (05/18/2012, 9:04 &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bspo.owl&gt;">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bspo.owl&gt;</ext-link> ). Wing vein terminology is included from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben (2003)</xref>. Fifty-six morphological characters, with 137 character states (Appendix I), were scored for all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species and outgroups treated in this study. All characters and character states are available in Appendix A.</p>
            <p><italic>Measurements </italic>. Mesosoma length is measured in lateral view from the anterior-most point of the pronotum to the posterior-most point of the metapectal-propodeal complex. All measurements were made with an ocular micrometer, installed inside an Olympus SZX16 Research Stereo Microscope.</p>
            <p><italic>Semantic phenotype development </italic>. 1) All phenotype data were captured in mx as a character matrix; 2) Descriptive matrix elements and mx-generated specimen identifiers were exported to OWL (Web Ontology Language, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/</ext-link> ); 3) OWL-formatted data from mx were loaded along with HAO, PATO, RO, and BSPO into Protégé 4.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">http://protege.stanford.edu/</ext-link> ); 4) Semantic phenotype annotations were manually added to character states within Protégé as OWL class expressions using the built-in Manchester syntax (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/</ext-link> ) editor. All phenotype statements in Manchester syntax are available in Appendix B.</p>
            <p><!--PageBreak--> <italic>Phylogenetics </italic>. Outgroups from four different genera were chosen from the closest known relatives based on estimated evaniid relationships using 16S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) data in MrBayes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Deans et al. 2006</xref>) and morphological similarity to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>), including a more distantly related species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Alobevania gattiae </tp:taxon-name></italic> Kawada and Deans 2008). To discover new characters of phylogenetic importance, we examined as many individuals of each species as possible and extracted homologous characters across species. A total of 31 parsimony-informative morphological characters were analyzed in this study. A parsimony analysis was performed with an exhaustive search in PAUP* version 4, beta 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Swofford 2002</xref>). The root was placed at <italic><tp:taxon-name>Alobevania gattiae </tp:taxon-name></italic>. Jackknife and bootstrap values were calculated using default settings with 1000 pseudoreplications.</p>
            <p><italic>Data management </italic>. Morphological characters, taxonomic concepts, descriptive language, electronic keys, and georeferenced collecting events were maintained in mx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Yoder et al. 2006</xref>). Over twenty researchers currently contribute to the development of the <tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera </tp:taxon-name> Anatomy Ontology (Yoder et. al 2010). Phylogenetic datasets, trees and associated metadata, such as specimen information and matrices, were exported from mx as NeXML and are deposited into TreeBASE. Semantic, marked-up phenotype annotations expressed in OWL are deposited in the Dryad Data repository. Mx-generated species pages are provided to the Encyclopedia of Life via XML exports.</p>
            <p><italic>Distribution map </italic>. Google Maps <bold><sup>®</sup></bold> is used to produce distribution maps for each species.

            <p><italic>Images </italic>. Specimens were examined using an Olympus SZX16 Research Stereo Microscope (at NCSU) and Leica MZ12.5 (at MZSP).

            <p><italic>Semantic phenotypes </italic>. Through the descriptive process, taxonomists stand to contribute an immense body of knowledge that could be used to address a broad array of questions in many realms of biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. 2012</xref>). How might phenotypes be correlated to climate change? Or how might changes in phenotype correspond with the environment? Presently, queries of characters that reference a specific part of the anatomy are already possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. 2012</xref>). There are, however, some current limitations in the workflow of semantic phenotype construction, e.g., ontologies often do not have sufficient content, using the software to manually create the statements can be complex, and it may prove challenging for taxonomists to alter their workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. 2012</xref>). Though some of the methods and tools used to build semantic phenotype annotations are in their infancy, semantic phenotypes hold the potential to unlock valuable data within taxonomic descriptions. For example, semantic phenotypes could become more meaningful when mapped across large-scale phylogenies; if we apply semantic phenotype annotations to specimens, phenotype data can be connected to evolutionary history through the organism’s phylogenetic relationships. Also, semantic phenotypes help make available millions of unambiguous data to a broad array of scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deans et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>The descriptive statements within this manuscript represent one of the first efforts in descriptive taxonomy to capture phenotypes using formalized, semantic methods. As a result of employing these new methods, a contemplative, calculated approach was taken in selecting terminology for characters and character states. The natural language descriptions in this manuscript were originally written with controlled vocabulary using terms present in ontologies that made the process of translation into semantic phenotypes relatively straightforward; for instance, a phenotype statement was written with the anatomical character followed by the descriptive character state, e.g., “dorsal area of metapectal-propodeal complex foveate”. The semantic phenotype statements resulting from these descriptions are more objective and less ambiguous than those frequently found in traditional taxonomic descriptions.</p>
            <p>In the original description of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus marginatus </tp:taxon-name></italic>, the mesonotum was described as “shining, bearing some large scattered punctures”. This description is vague. To make it more explicit, we changed the character name to “distance between depressions vs. diameter of depressions on internotaular area” and the states to “0: greater than (or 1: less than) the diameter of one depression”. This is more specific than the presence of some large scattered punctures on the mesonotum, but making a semantic statement from this character was not particularly intuitive (for semantic statement, see Appendix B). For the majority of characters in the descriptions presented here, the process of translation to more meaningful semantic statements was not as complicated.</p>
            <p>Semantic phenotypes in these taxonomic descriptions were created in a logical manner by means of extracting anatomical information from an organism-specific ontology, such as the HAO, and pairing this with a quality from a general trait ontology (PATO). The natural language description persists, but a machine-readable interpretation is constructed that can be stored on the Semantic Web, where the valuable phenotypic data can easily be mined by computers and captured for use by taxonomists, biologists, or, essentially, anyone who wants to query the database of descriptions. Taxonomy that includes ontology-based descriptions, such as those presented in this manuscript, avails phenotype data to experts in all domains through bioinformatics applications.</p>
            <p><!--PageBreak--><italic>Geographic distribution </italic>. In addition to the discovery of two new species, our results expand upon the geographical range of the four previously described species. Subsequently to the original descriptions, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic> has been collected in northeast Guyana, northern Brazil, and Trinidad. The range of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> has been expanded into north-central western Brazil, northeastern and southern Ecuador, and southern Colombia. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus marginatus </tp:taxon-name></italic> was described from Guatemala, and has now been collected in Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador.</p>
            <p>The majority of described evaniid species to date are from tropical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>), which is consistent with the primarily tropical and subtropical distribution of cockroaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vélez 2008</xref>). In Colombia alone, there are 133 species of cockroaches present, 10 of which are found in Amazonas and five of which are non-blaberids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vélez 2008</xref>). Since the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus lansdownei </tp:taxon-name></italic> was collected in Amazonas, one of these cockroach species could potentially represent the host of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus lansdownei </tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, four of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens in this study were collected at the entrance to Tamana Caves, Trinidad. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Blaberus posticus </tp:taxon-name></italic> dominates the cockroach fauna in this area, but because this is a blaberid and retains the ootheca within the abdominal wall, as do all other species dwelling in the caves, it is highly unlikely that they could be the host of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Darlington 1970</xref>).</p>
            <p><italic>Color variation </italic>. Some insects exhibit varying levels of intraspecific polychromatism or heterochromatism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berniker and Weirauch (2012)</xref> identified species of the reduviid genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Apiomerus </tp:taxon-name></italic> that exhibit intraspecific polychromatism; some species showed discrete color morphs while others showed only limited polychromatism in the pronotum and the corium. Some individuals of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Apiomerus californicus </tp:taxon-name></italic> collected along the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California showed an increased red pigmentation, which suggested a possible correlation between color variation and elevation. In the ichneumonid <italic><tp:taxon-name>Aphidius smithi </tp:taxon-name></italic>, adult wasps that were reared at different temperatures during the mid to late pupal stage displayed constant differences in integumental coloration, especially in the face, thorax and petiole; when wasps were reared at higher tempteratures, the face and mesothorax were orange, but when reared at lower temperatures, these parts in adults were black (Shu-Sheng and Carver 1982).</p>
            <p>In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic>, heterochromatism is limited to the head and mesosoma in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic>. The most distinct color morph of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> has the dorsal half of the upper face and vertex black while the ventral half of the upper face and lower face is red or yellow. However, a few males and females have an entirely red head. A similar color pattern can be applied to the mesosoma in this species; the majority of specimens have the postero-ventral region of the mesosoma black and the antero-dorsal region red, but some males and females have an entirely red mesosoma. The same variation in head color pattern applies to some specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic>, including the holotype.</p>
            <p>With the limited availability of specimens in this study, it is difficult to determine if there is any correlation with color variation and biogeography in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic>, or if rearing temperature plays a role in adult coloration. The females with entirely red heads were collected in Ecuador with the exception of one specimen collected in Brazil. This <!--PageBreak--> heterochromatism is not female-limited, however, since males of the species do exhibit the same red color morph. There is geographical overlap between the red morphs and the more common specimens with the dorsal half of the upper face and vertex black and the postero-ventral region of the mesosoma black and the antero-dorsal region red. In addition to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic>, intraspecific polychromatism has also been observed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hyptia thoracica </tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens collected in the Sandhills Gamelands in North Carolina, with up to 8 different color morphs all present in the same area (personal observation, PLM).</p>
            <p><italic>Systematics </italic>. In the morphological analysis, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evansicus </tp:taxon-name></italic> was well supported as a monophyletic lineage (bootstrap support=90, jackknife support=89). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rafaeli </tp:taxon-name></italic> was placed as sister to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic>, and these two share several synapomorphic character states: posterior margin of the metapectal-propodeal complex ventrally of the propodeal foramen curvature in lateral view: straight; scape length vs compound eye height: scape longer than half compound eye height; mesoscutum shape: wider than long (length of mesoscutum &lt; width of mesoscutum); distance between depressions vs. diameter of depressions on internotaular area: less than the diameter of one depression; dorsal region of petiole sculpture: wrinkled; metafemur length vs. metatibia length: metafemur longer than metatibia. While these two species share several characteristics, the support for their monophyly is moderate (bootstrap=72, jackknife=67). Nearly 25% of parsimony informative characters were apomorphies for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic>. Despite the morphological analysis placing <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic> as sister to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rafaeli </tp:taxon-name></italic>, to the naked eye this species looks distinctly different from other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species, and our understanding of the placement of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic> would benefit from future molecular analyses.</p>
            <p>The clade of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> comprising <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus lansdownei </tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus marginatus </tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus sulcigenis </tp:taxon-name></italic> was moderately supported (bootstrap support=76, jackknife support=72), but all species share several derived character states: posterior margin of the metapectal-propodeal complex ventrally of the propodeal foramen curvature in lateral view: curved; scape length vs compound eye height: scape shorter than half compound eye height; mesoscutum shape: as long as wide (length of mesoscutum &gt; width of mesoscutum); distance between depressions vs. diameter of depressions on internotaular area: greater than the diameter of one depression; dorsal region of petiole sculpture: foveate.</p>
            <p>In addition to those published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>, 18 characters that all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species share have been documented in this manuscript. Previous to this study, very few females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> had been observed, and it was thought that the ovipositor is short and completely hidden within the metasoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>). However, we have seen the ovipositor in several female specimens, and it extends to the tip of the metasoma; if the ovipositor was concealed when the insect was preserved, the female metasoma looks identical to that of the male.</p>
            <p>Based on the lack of morphological variation and the results of the present analysis, we consider <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus sulcigenis </tp:taxon-name></italic> to be a junior synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic>. Both species share all external morphological character states examined in this study, except for <!--PageBreak-->some variable color patterns. Further comprehensive morphological studies in addition to molecular studies are required to fully confirm this hypothesis; however, since the only available specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus sulcigenis </tp:taxon-name></italic> is the holotype specimen, these future studies may not be practical.</p>
            <p><italic>Sexual dimorphism </italic>. <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name> are usually sexually dimorphic in their antennal morphology, body coloration, facial sculpturing, and/or metasomal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Deans and Huben 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Deans and Kawada 2008</xref>). For example, females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Decevania </tp:taxon-name></italic> have a distinctly sculptured head, flattened, small eyes, the antennal segments are enlarged progressively from the fourth flagellomere, and the posterior region of the metasoma is expanded dorso-ventrally with the ovipositor usually concealed; males usually have larger bulging eyes, antennal segments all the same diameter, and the posterior region of the metasoma constricted dorsoventrally with genitalia protracted (depending upon preservation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kawada and Azevedo 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kawada 2011</xref>). In addition, color pattern variation in male and female specimens of many species have also been observed (personal observation). All <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species are identical in coloration, except for those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> (as discussed above).</p>
            <p>Many hymenopterans have sexually dimorphic antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Deans and Kawada 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Gauld and Fitton 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Wharton 1980</xref>; Onagboloa et al. 2009). Antennae of most species of <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name> are also sexually dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Deans and Kawada 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kawada and Azevedo 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kawada 2011</xref>). In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic>, females have a ventral sensillar patch on flagellomeres 6–12 or 8–12, whereas males do not, and many females also have flagellomeres that are distinctly wider than long, where male flagellomeres are as long as wide or longer than wide. In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus marginatus </tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus tibialis </tp:taxon-name></italic>, for example, flagellomeres 1–8 are distinctly wider than long in the female, but not in the male. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rufithorax </tp:taxon-name></italic> is likely unique among <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus </tp:taxon-name></italic> species in that the antennal flagellomeres do not exhibit the flagellomere shape sexual dimorphism; however, a ventral sensillar patch on flagellomeres 6–12 is present in females but not in males. We cannot be certain this is the only species that exhibits this character state, as the male is not yet known for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus rafaeli </tp:taxon-name></italic> and females are still unknown for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus lansdownei </tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Evaniscus sulcigenis </tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
            <p>Another difference between male and female <tp:taxon-name>Evaniidae </tp:taxon-name> specimens is the connection between the petiole and the first abdominal segment. This difference can be observed in a longitudinal section through the junction between the two sclerites in the petiole. In males, the foramen of the petiole receives the connection to the junction of the first abdominal tergite and sternite. The first abdominal tergite has a folding anterior edge along with the first abdominal sternite. These are generally divided into two sclerites: a lower tubular sclerite and another larger sclerite, which covers a large area of the first abdominal sternum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 32</xref>). In the females, the first abdominal tergite and sternite are expanded to cover the distal region of the petiole. Internally, the anterior portion of the tergite and sternite are curved to the inner wall of the petiole and connected to it by a thin membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 33</xref>).<!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--></p>
