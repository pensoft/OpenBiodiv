      <p>PhytoKeys was launched on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 2010 as a novel, peer-reviewed, open-access outlet for plant biodiversity research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Penev et al. 2010a</xref>). The journal quickly gained the support of the international botanical community and since its launch continues to grow in reputation and volume.</p>
      <p>The journal implemented several innovative technologies, such as a domain specific XML markup based on the TaxPub Schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Catapano 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Penev et al. 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Penev et al. 2011</xref>), compliant to the PubMedCentral standards, data publishing, automated export of content through web services to various aggregators, such as the Encyclopedia of Life <!--PageBreak-->(EOL), the Global Biodiversity Information Facilities (GBIF), Species-ID, bibliographic indices and so on (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Kress and Penev 2011</xref>). PhytoKeys became one of the very few journals in plant systematics to be accepted for coverage and archiving in PubMedCentral. The journal was the first to implement mandatory registration of new species and nomenclature changes with the International Plant Name Index (IPNI). PhytoKeysis CrossRef-compliant and plans also to use ORCID authors’ registry once it becomes fully operational, hopefully in 2013. The data publishing workflow in PhytoKeys is already integrated with the Dryad Data Repository and GBIF.</p>
      <p>PhytoKeys was the first journal to announce the revolutionary changes instituted in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN) in a paper published during the actual proceedings of the XVIII International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011, bringing the news to a world-wide audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Miller et al. 2011</xref>). Thanks to the decisions of the Nomenclature Section of the Congress (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Knapp et al. 2011a</xref>), electronic publication of new taxa was allowed and PhytoKeys was again the first journal to demonstrate an immediate implementation of the Congress decisions, starting on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January with a series of exemplar papers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Vorontsova and Knapp 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Tepe et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Thomas et al. 2012</xref>), each paper with its individual publication date. The completed journal issue was printed on paper on the 7th of January 2012, demonstrating our commitment of the multiple archiving of botanical content.</p>
      <p>Since its launch the journal has received 130 submissions in total. Out of this number, 90 articles (1,456 pages) were published in volumes 1–18. Twenty-one manuscripts have been archived by the system because they were rejected during the review process, withdrawn from consideration or cancelled for other reasons. The yearly growth in numbers of published articles, issues, and number of pages in PhytoKeys has been substantial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The growth in number of published pages in the second year of PhytoKeys exceeds by 120% that of year 1. Starting with 35 articles in 2010–2011, in the second year the journal showed a substantial growth in submissions (66%) and published articles (50%). Based on the analysis of 30 randomly selected papers, the average publication time (from submission to publication) for the first two years of the existence of the journal is 78 days. The period between submission and acceptance is 63 days, and from acceptance to publication 15 days.</p>

      <p>PhytoKeys has always been engaged with open data publishing. One of the pioneering methods for data publishing converted a conventional floristic checklist, written in a standard word processing program, into structured data in the Darwin Core Archive format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Remsen et al. 2012</xref>). A manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">De Egea et al. 2012</xref>) consisting of more than 4,100 taxon names, was submitted to PhytoKeys as a Microsoft Word file. After peer-review and editorial acceptance, the final revised version was converted into the Darwin Core Archive format from the original manuscript and published both as a conventional paper in PhytoKeys and as DwC-A structured data through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) <!--PageBreak-->Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT). In addition, and for the convenience of the readers and data users, the same data were also published as a supplementary Excel file in an Appendix to the checklist (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.9.2279.app1">10.3897/phytokeys.9.2279.app1</ext-link>). After publication, the data became available through the GBIF infrastructure in order to be re-used on their own or collated with other data.</p>
      <p>The first data paper in PhytoKeys was published in May 2012 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Van Landuyt et al. (2012)</xref>. It described “Florabank1” – a database comprising distributional data on the wild plants of Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region of Belgium.<!--PageBreak--></p>
      <p>The top ten papers in PhytoKeys through the 5<sup>th</sup> of December 2012 have been accessed 55,502 times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). The article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Popovkin et al.

      <p>In order to promote plant taxonomy, Pensoft’s Public Relations office has initiated a new service aimed at facilitating our authors in promoting their research among the general public and science media. Since its launch, altogether 17 international press releases have been prepared and distributed through EurekAlert!, one of the world largest online distributors of science news, supplying information to more than 7,500 mass media and independent science journalists, and Pensoft’s own channels (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> for the top ten most accessed press releases of PhytoKeys articles). At the top, with approxmately 5,000 views, is the press release of the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Vallejo-Marín (2012)</xref> describing a new monkey flower, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="7856f7e9-00ae-47c0-ac3b-4632f1161321" obkms_process="TRUE">Mimulus peregrinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<tp:taxon-name obkms_id="a0718035-27f6-4442-be2b-3eb4f3269ce0" obkms_process="TRUE">Phrymaceae</tp:taxon-name>) discovered on the bank of a stream in Scotland created by the union of two foreign plant species. This paper described a rare example of a new species that originated in the wild in the last 150 years.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, PhytoKeys, along with its 'brother' journals Zookeys and MycoKeys, continues to evolve its editorial workflow, constantly implementing new and improved publishing and dissemination technologies, thus always being on point for digital biodiversity science. We would like to thank all of our authors, reviewers, subject editors, readers, and journalistic followers without whose support PhytoKeys would not have become such a successful journal in just two years time! We also thank Christine Barker (IPNI) for providing information on the nomenclatural novelties published in PhytoKeys that have been registered in IPNI.<!--PageBreak--></p>
