        <p>Changes to the <italic>International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</italic> are decided on every 6 years at Nomenclature Sections associated with International Botanical Congresses (IBC). The XVIII IBC was held in Melbourne, Australia; the Nomenclature Section met on 18-22 July 2011 and its decisions were accepted by the Congress at its plenary session on 30 July. Several important changes were made to the <italic>Code</italic> as a result of this meeting that will affect publication of new names.

Electronic material published online in Portable Document Format (PDF) with an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) will constitute effective publication, and the requirement for a Latin description or diagnosis for names of new taxa will be changed to a requirement for a description or diagnosis in either Latin or English. In addition, effective from 1 January 2013, new names of organisms treated as fungi must, in order to be validly published, include in the protologue (everything associated with a name at its valid publication) the citation of an identifier issued by a recognized repository (such as MycoBank).

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>At the XVIII International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia, in July 2011, two important changes were made to the <italic>International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</italic> (now the <italic>International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</italic>) that will take effect from 1 January 2012. These changes will affect everyone who publishes names governed by this <italic>Code</italic>. As the <italic>Melbourne Code</italic> will not be published until approximately mid-2012, we felt it would be helpful to outline these changes, particularly those concerning effective publication in electronic media (in Articles 29, 30, and 31). For a concise report on all the changes to the <italic>Code</italic> accepted in Melbourne, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">McNeill et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
      <p>A draft wording of the revised Articles, Notes, and Recommendations on effective publication is provided to aid editors and publishers in establishing best practice for implementing this aspect of the <italic>Code</italic>. We also outline here what these changes do <italic>not</italic> mean, to guide those wishing to publish new names and typifications by electronic means. We urge readers to consult the report of the Special Committee on Electronic Publication accompanying the changes proposed before the Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Chapman et al. 2010</xref>), wherein the reasoning for the changes now accepted into the <italic>Code</italic> is set out.</p>

Authors should also avoid publishing new names and descriptions or diagnoses in popular periodicals, in abstracting journals, or on correction slips.</p>
        <p><italic>30A.3.</italic> To aid availability through time and place, authors publishing nomenclatural novelties should give preference to periodicals that regularly publish taxonomic articles. <bold>Otherwise, a copy of a publication (whether published as printed or electronic matter) should be sent to an indexing centre appropriate to the taxonomic group, and publications that exist only as printed matter</bold> should be deposited in at least ten, but preferably more, botanical or other generally accessible libraries throughout the world.</p>

      <title>Best practice</title>
      <p>Authors of new names, editors and publishers will all be interested in ensuring that the publications including new names are in accordance with the <italic>Melbourne Code</italic>, so that the names therein are effectively published. We suggest that those publishing in journals or monograph series and books that have online editions communicate with the editors so that best practice can be established across the community as quickly as possible. Many publishers have been carefully addressing the issues involved with the e-publication of novelties for some time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Knapp and Wright 2010</xref>; guidelines in PLoS One [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#taxon">http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#taxon</ext-link>]) and considerable interest in making these new <italic>Code</italic> changes function effectively has been apparent.</p>
      <p>Some practices that we feel will help with the initial stages of e-publication of novelties that are according to the <italic>Melbourne Code</italic> are:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Having each article bear the date of publication prominently (as is done in many journals, for example <italic>New Phytologist</italic> or <italic>Nature</italic>).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	If an online early version is issued that is not the same as the final version (and thus not the place of effective publication), stamp each article with this fact prominently (for example <italic>American Journal of Botany</italic>).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Prominent display of the ISSN or ISBN of the publication on each article will help indexers establish effective publication.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Publication in journals (or monograph series) that participate in the CLOCKSS system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Knapp and Wright 2010</xref> for a description) or another international archive and preservation system will ensure long-term archiving.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Authors of new names by electronic means should alert the appropriate indexing center as recommended in Rec. 30A.3 - this will help indexers who may otherwise not be aware of electronically published names.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="What these changes do not mean">
      <title>What these changes do <italic>not</italic> mean</title>
      <p>Although the new Articles and Recommendations use the terms PDF and PDF/A, this does not mean that publications must be issued <italic>only</italic> in that format to be effectively published. For example, some online journals issue papers in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format together with a parallel PDF version. In such cases, the PDF version will be effectively published. The stipulation that the General Committee for Botanical Nomenclature will communicate the acceptability of a new international standard format, should PDF ever be succeeded, means authors of novelties and the community using the <italic>Code</italic> can remain informed as to advances in the field and that the <italic>Code</italic> will be protected from obsolescence.</p>
      <p>Use of the following means of electronic publication will <italic>not</italic> result in effective publication of novelties under the <italic>Melbourne Code</italic>:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Publication on websites or in ephemeral documents available over the Internet (there are strict criteria for granting of ISSNs [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.issn.org">http://www.issn.org</ext-link>]).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Publication in journals without a registered ISSN or e-ISSN.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>•	Publication in books without a registered ISBN or e-ISBN.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The Recommendation approved to advise the deposition of a hard copy of any e-publication in a library suggests to botanists an action, but it does not set out standard practice or a protocol for librarians to follow. Librarians are themselves in a complex transition zone between publication modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Johnson and Luther 2007</xref>), and botanists may find librarians to be unwilling or unable to accommodate single hard copy papers as individual accessions should the volume be great.</p>

    <sec sec-type="Two other important changes to the Code relating to the publication of names">
      <title>Two other important changes to the <italic>Code</italic> relating to the publication of names</title>
      <p>The second change to the <italic>Code</italic> approved in Melbourne to take effect from 1 January 2012 is that the description or diagnosis required for valid publication of the name of a new taxon of all organisms falling under the <italic>Code</italic> may be in either English or Latin. This is the current provision for names of plant fossils, but all new non-fossil taxa have required a Latin description or diagnosis (fungi and plants from 1 January 1935; algae [including cyanobacteria, if treated under the <italic>Code</italic>] from 1 January 1958). This has no bearing on the form of scientific names, which continue to be Latin or treated as Latin. Individual journal requirements for Latin and/or English will, of course, be determined by the editors of those journals.</p>
      <p>A third change to the <italic>Code</italic> approved in Melbourne relating to publication of names, but one not taking effect until 1 January 2013 (not 1 January 2012 as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Miller et al. 2011</xref>), is that all new names of organisms treated as fungi must, as an additional requirement for valid publication, include in the protologue (everything associated with a name at its valid publication) the citation of an identifier issued by a recognized repository (such as MycoBank [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mycobank.org/">http://www.mycobank.org/</ext-link>]). This will be publicized separately.<!--PageBreak--></p>
      <p>The requirement for a unique identifier for new names of fungi on or after 1 January 2013 does <italic>not</italic> apply to plants or algae; there is no need for authors of new names in these groups to request Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) - or other identifiers - from indexing centers.</p>
