        <sec sec-type="Introduction">
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chaudoir, 1875, is a member of the subtribe <tp:taxon-name>Cimindidina</tp:taxon-name> Laporte de Castelnau, 1834, tribe <tp:taxon-name>Lebiini</tp:taxon-name>. Originally, it was established for a single species to which five more species were added afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bates 1892</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Andrewes 1935</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Emden 1937</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Kirschenhofer (2010)</xref> contributed further five species to the genus, these being new or earlier described by him in the genera <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cymindis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Latreile, 1806, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Perseus</tp:taxon-name></italic> <!--PageBreak-->Kirschenhofer, 2003. He also downgraded the latter genus to a subgenus of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius</tp:taxon-name></italic> and placed there all congeners, leaving the nominate subgenus monobasic. While the genus is widespread in the Oriental realm, its members have been recorded from type or few close localities, implying highly limited species ranges. Yet this does not seem to be the case because the adults of most of the species are winged and fly well.
            </p>
            <p>The species diversity in the genus is unevenly distributed across the realm. In particular, five species have been reported from India, one from Myanmar, another one from Malay Peninsula, three from the Greater Sunda Isles (Java and Borneo), and only one species from Vietnam, <tp:taxon-name>Indochina</tp:taxon-name>. Several recent expeditions of the Joint Russia-Vietnam Tropical Center to southern Vietnamese provinces have shown that Vietnam actually supports a rich fauna of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
            </p>
            <p>Six new species are described below from material taken during those expeditions, with a key to all congeners being provided to follow those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Andrewes (1935)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Kirschenhofer (2010)</xref>. I also think it advisable to refine descriptions of the genus, as well as its two species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius sabahensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, by adding some important characters absent from the original descriptions. Indices used are based on the measurements as follows: total body length between the apices of the mandibles and elytra, length of the elytra from their basal margins to the apices, maximum widths of both the pronotum, elytra and head across eyes, as well as length of the pronotum along its mid-line.
            </p>
            <p>Holotypes and some paratypes are deposited in the Zoological Museum of the Moscow State University, the other paratypes in the author’s reference collection, A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology &amp; Evolution, Russian Academy of Sciences (SIEE). A few specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius</tp:taxon-name></italic> have also been studied from the collection of the Moscow Pedagogical State University (MPSU). All the labels are typewritten, type ones also being red. These are uniform as follows: “HOLOTYPE or PARATYPE / Taridius / species name, sp. n. / D. Fedorenko des., 2011”.

                    <title>Redescription.</title>
                    <p>Body medium-sized, subconvex to flattened. Dorsum glabrous, ventral surface glabrous or sparsely ciliate. Body dark brown to black, mouthparts, clypeus anteriorly, antennae, legs, propleura, reflexed side margin of pronotum, pronotal apex before site of front transverse impression, as well as base behind basal transverse impression mostly pale, yellow. Elytra black or dark brown, usually with a pale, yellow to pale brown, side border, epipleura and an ornate pattern which sometimes bears very slight bronzed reflexions over dark color. This pale pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) is generally composed of a<!--PageBreak--> large apical spot (PAS) and a humeral vitta (PHS) subdivided into two. Its external part, PHSe, long, running on intervals 6 and 7 and expanded onto 5th behind, while a shorter and smaller internal part, PHSi, occupying intervals 2 to 4 or 3 and 4 before middle. When increasingly extended backwards, PHSe makes a subequally wide, dark, subtransverse, medial fascia (DMF) constricted in interval 6 first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 3–5</xref>) and divided into a common (post)median spot (DMS) and a submarginal strip (DLS) after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 8–10</xref>). DLS runs on intervals 7 and 8, while tending to be reduced to a small patch at the middle and another one, vague to missing, behind shoulder. The remaining part of the dark pattern, a rounded to quadrate dark spot around scutellum on intervals 1 to 4–5 (DSS) is extended into a sutural strip (DSF) running on intervals 1–2 and tapering behind DMF or DMS. When entire, the dark pattern resembles a flying bird with open wings. Middle of prosternum, meso- and metaventrite mostly pale, reddish or reddish-yellow.
                    </p>
                    <p><!--PageBreak-->Microsculpture isodiametric on head and elytra, before anterior transverse impression and behind basal transverse impression of pronotum, as well as along its side margin and often also over its more or less wide, posterolateral area. Microsculpture on pronotal disc grated, composed of transverse, very wide and evenly rectangular meshes, rarely these being isodiametric (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius coriaceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.). Sometimes longitudinal meshes traceable along side margin between antero- and posterolateral setigerous pores (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius piceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.). Elytral microsculpture conspicuous, that on head and pronotal disc often obsolete. Head and pronotum minutely and sparsely punctate.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eyes convex, genae short to rather long but not or barely projecting, head mostly broadest level to a little before 1/2 length of eye tubercle (eye and gena combined); frontal longitudinal carinae 2–5, rarely seven, on each side. Labrum rectangular, wider than long, very slightly emarginate at and sexsetose along front margin. Submentum bisetose, tooth of mentum stout, rather widely rounded apically, with two setae at middle. Ligula rather wide, truncate, bisetose, paraglossae adnate, slightly surpassing ligula, widely rounded apically. Penultimate labial palpomere plurisetose internally, apical joint fusiform to subtriangular. Antennae filiform, pubescent from antennomere 4 onwards, about last three joints surpassing elytral base, antennomeres 1, 3 and 4 subequally long, 3rd two thirds to nine tenths longer than 2nd; basal three joints with several cilia or very short hairs in addition to standard setae, 2nd mostly with three, preapical, lateral setae anteriorly.</p>
                    <p>Pronotum bisetose on each side, exceptionally trisetose anteriorly (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius opaculus</tp:taxon-name></italic>), subcordate, broadest far before middle, with front margin slightly sinuate, front angles angles which barely projecting in the latter case. Anterior border interrupted medially, straight or barely sinuate before base; hind angles subrectangular to predominantly obtuse or highly so and rounded. Base oblique towards and often rounded at hind angles which hardly projecting in the latter case. Anterior border interrupted medially, basal border entire, sometimes weaker or interrupted in the middle. Side margin rather widely explanate and strongly reflexed, more so basad, often with more or less dense and large but shallow punctures throughout or only basally. Mid-line fine but moderately deep, extremities excluded, both front and basal transverse impressions weak to indistinct, basal foveae wide, shallow, mostly reduced to a small but rather deep pit just before basal border, giving rise to side gutter, basal transverse impression and a fine to indistinct paralateral line as internal border of basal fovea. A flattened area between this line (or its virtual forward extension) and side border rather densely transversely rugulose, sometimes coriaceous, a sparser and shallower rugosities over disc.
                    </p>
                    <p>Elytra oblong-oval, humeri rounded, apical truncature slightly oblique, a little sinuate, with outer angle widely or obtusely rounded, apices truncate and mostly sharp, rectangular to slightly obtuse, with an almost indistinct re-entrant angle in the latter case. Angle between side and basal borders (humeral angle) absent or, exceptionally, highly obtuse opposite stria 7, basal border entire and slightly sinuate. Elytral striae moderately deep all along, impunctate or crenulate at base, intervals flat, sometimes (individual variability) odd narrower and a little more convex than even ones. Interval 8 sharply carinate internally in anterior three fourths. Dorsal setigerous<!--PageBreak--> pores two, evenly spaced along stria 3, exceptionally (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius nilgiricus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Andrewes, 1935) serial on intervals 3 and 5. Umbilicate series uninterrupted and composed of <italic>ca</italic> 16 setigerous pores. Wings well-developed in all congeners examined but <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius piceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. Metepisterna long.
                    </p>
                    <p>Apical margin of last abdominal sternite (VII) bisetose in both sexes but quadrisetose in females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kirschenhofer, 2010 and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius andrewesi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Emden, 1937.
                    </p>
                    <p>Profemur unisetose in the middle of postero-ventral edge, metacoxa bisetose along outer margin of its posterior part, metatrochanter unisetose, metafemur bisetose; meso- and metatibia dorsally with a more or less distinct, longitudinal sulcus, its edges carinate or at least sharp. Tarsi glabrous dorsally, claw joint setose beneath, claws pectinate. Meso- and metatarsomere 1 as long as the following two combined. Basal three protarsomeres of male dilated and furnished with adhesive vestiture.</p>
                    <p>Penis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 17</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">28</xref>) in dorsal view mostly with a wide, premedian, swell on right side, apical lamella subtriangular to parallel-sided, widely rounded at tip. Parameres of similar shape in different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 29–32</xref>).
                    </p>
                    <p>Female gonocoxite IX with two, inner (dorsal) and outer (ventral), ensiform setae varying in size between species. The best developed gonocoxite and setae, especially inner ones, tend to be reduced from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius coriaceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 39–46</xref>), inner seta becoming very small and invisible in some species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 43–46</xref>).

                    <p>The beetles occur at the altitudes of 150–1800 m asl where they dwell in leaf-litter of monsoon, broad-leaved, tropical or subtropical forests. Only two specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> were taken in coniferous forests, among them a paratype collected in a <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pinus dalatensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> forest using pitfall traps and a female from Chu Yang Sin caught by hands in leaf-litter of an elfin wood under trees of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chamaecyparis hodginsii</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dunn, 1908). At higher altitudes, the adults were predominantly taken by pitfall trapping. This is true of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius piceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> found to occur syntopically. At low altitudes, beetles mostly flew to lights at night. These were <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius fasciatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius abdominalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> taken together, as well as a paratype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. A specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius abdominalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. was sifted from bamboo leaf litter and individual specimens of the other species (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius coriaceus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic>) were only occasionally collected by hand on the soil surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>It follows also that up to five species can live sympatrically and at least two syntopically as well. The sympatric species were found to be as follows: (1) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius piceus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius coriaceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius fasciatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Bi Doup – Nui Ba Nature Reserve, (2) (1) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Chu Yang Sin National Park, (3) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius fasciatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius abdominalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Bu Gia Map National Park.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, the fact that different species or their groups show female styli of strongly different structure implies differences in the substrates, soil or leaf-litter of different kind, the larval stages inhabit.</p>

                    <p>(1) The congeners are all alike because of a great similarity in body shape. Yet, when combined, the color patterns of both the elytra and the ventral sur<!--PageBreak-->face of the hindbody are features sufficiently distinctive to discriminate most of the species with certainty.</p>
                    <p>(2) According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Kirschenhofer (2010)</xref>, two structural characters, the shape of the last labial palpomere and the number of pronotal anterolateral setae, separate the subgenus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Perseus</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the nominate one which comprises <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius opaculus</tp:taxon-name></italic> only. In particular, a spindle-shaped palpomere and a single, standard, seta on the pronotum are peculiar to the former subgenus, whereas a subcylindric palpomere, combined with three anterolateral setae, to the latter. However, the palpomere has been found to be somewhat variable in shape. Firstly, it is subcylindric in males but fusiform in females. Secondly, the apically broadest palpomere is that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius piceus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., the species showing only one anterolateral seta on the pronotum. This leaves the polymerous anterolateral setae on the pronotum as the only support to an isolated position of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius opaculus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Yet, the support is weak because some other characters taken separate, <italic>eg</italic>, the serial dorsal setae on the elytra in the case of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius nilgiricus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, could also provoke the erection of a monobasic subgenus if necessary, polymerous pronotal and elytral setae are deemed hardly different for that purpose. Based on the above evidence, I refrain here from subdividing the genus into the subgenera pending a comparative analysis of male and female genitalia, as well as the number of setae on abdominal sternite VII of the female.
                    </p>
                    <p>At least two lineages have been traced within the genus. The members of the first lineage share the last abdominal sternite bisetose in both sexes, as well as rather weak female styli supplied with strongly reduced ensiform setae. In addition, the dark elytral pattern is mostly entire, the facial carinae are more numerous, and often also the dorsal microsculpture is superficial on the head and pronotum. In the second lineage which includes <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius disjunctus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius andrewesi</tp:taxon-name></italic> and probably also <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius pahangensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kirschenhofer, 2003), females are distinctive in showing four setae on the last abdominal sternite. A rather pale elytral pattern, conspicuous dorsal microsculpture, less numerous frontal carinae and strongly armed female styli, albeit this feature has been examined in but two species, are among additional characters of the lineage.

                    <p>Body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 13</xref>) subconvex and small, 6.6–7.5 mm long. Dorsum black and shining, except for elytra. Pronotal pale pattern rather extensive along anterior and posterior margins. Elytral pale pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1, 2</xref>) fairly extensive as well, dark pattern entire, DMF moderately and subequally wide throughout, extended to interval 9 anteriorly and 8 posteriorly, with both front and back margins flexuose; its forward <!--PageBreak-->extension along side margin (conformable to DLS) occupying intervals 8 and 9; DSS rounded laterally, on intervals 1 to 5 before while on 1 to 4 behind, mostly angulate posterolaterally, with a straight or concave back margin; one to two inner intervals involved in DSF, often one anteriorly and two just before DMF. PHS entire, PHSi about 1/2 its length posterior to PHSe, the latter extended to interval 7 at humerus. Sometimes PHSe very narrowly separated from PHSi or surpassing it, in the latter case DMF constricted in interval 6. PAS front margin oblique. Ventral surface colored as in previous two species. Microsculpture sharp on elytra, absent from or almost invisible on head, extremely fine on pronotum and obsolete either before its middle or over greater part of disc, posterolateral region excluded; microsculpture a little sharper in female as being very superficial but traceable over head and/or pronotum.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eyes large and convex, together with genae almost semicircular in outline; frons with 4–5, more often four, carinae on each side, outer ones long, inner not surpassing anterior supraorbital seta; sometimes carinae unilaterally amplified in number to six,<!--PageBreak--> irregular, or, otherwise, reduced to three, long ones. Vertex almost flat, neck-constriction barely traceable.</p>
                    <p>Pronotum 1.19–1.28 (mean 1.25, n=8) times as wide as head, 1.34–1.42 (mean 1.38) times as wide as long, basal margin slightly convex backwards or its almost straight medial part slightly produced, with lateral parts oblique towards and a little rounded at hind angles; anterior margin weakly sinuate, sides subsinuate to straight in basal half, mostly very shortly sinuate just before base, hind angles obtuse or very so, sharp to nearly indistinct. Front transverse impression obliterate, basal transverse impression shallow to moderately deep medially and deeper laterally, thus adjoining or forming a small, more or less deep, transverse pit at bottom of an almost reduced basal fovea, a very fine paralateral line traceable in basal third only. Basal border entire, anterior border very narrow, interrupted at middle. Rugosities rather dense and sharp, especially so posterolaterally, sparser and shallower in the middle of disc. Only reflexed side margin with large, sparse and shallow punctures combined with shorter rugosities.</p>
                    <p>Elytra flat, oblong-oval to reversely subovate, 1.44–1.57 (mean 1.51) times as long as wide, 1.57–1.71 (mean 1.63) times as wide as pronotum. Striae indistinctly crenulate, intervals subequally wide, flat or barely convex. Last abdominal sternite bisetose along apical margin in both sexes.</p>

                    <p>This insect is very similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius vietnamensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., differing from both in the smaller body size and the dorsal microsculpture which is never totally absent from the pronotum. As compared to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius vietnamensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the explanate side margin of the pronotum is narrower and less strongly reflexed, with a sharper side gutter, as well as the frontal carinae on each side are four or five instead of three.
                    </p>
                    <p>Variability. Two additional specimens from higher altitudes (see below) are distinctive in a slightly larger body size and a posteriorly deeper side gutter of the pronotum due to its more strongly reflexed side margin. Furthermore, the male from Thailand shows the pronotum with transverse rugosities denser over the disc, especially along sides, a densely punctate side margin and almost straight lateral parts of the base, as well as the frontal carinae being still more numerous, six or seven, before. Besides this, the apical lamella of the penis is barely curved upwards in lateral view. Yet the endophallus is the same, implying that the differences are intraspecific, subspecific at best.</p>

                    <p>The species is certain to belong to the group which members share the last abdominal sternite bisetose in both sexes. From all of them, it differs by separate, dark, elytral DLS, peculiar pronotal sculpture and microsculpture, as well as by a particular structure of the female gonocoxite IX. A similar elytral pattern is observed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius stevensi</tp:taxon-name></italic> which is in contrast smaller and devoid of bronzed luster over dark color. Well-developed DLS and a dark abdomen are uncharacteristic of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius pahangensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the former species showing a quadrisetose abdominal sternite VII.

                    <p>Body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 16</xref>) subconvex, 8.2–8.9 mm in length. Dorsum black, moderately shining. Elytral dark pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 8</xref>) with slight but distinct bronzed luster, strongly reduced laterally: DSS rounded, with inner four intervals involved in, emarginate at DSF which running on sutural interval only, DMS expanded outwards as far as stria 5, DLS reduced to a very small median patch on interval 7 or also on 8. Underside colored as in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius ornatus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Microsculpture sharp on elytra, moderately sharp over pronotum and head, superficial to obsolete on neck.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eyes slightly reduced, genae rather long and oblique but not projecting, head broadest in anterior third of eye tubercle length; frontal carinae mostly three, among them inner one shorter and shallower anteriorly. Vertex rather convex, neck-constriction distinct.</p>
                    <p>Pronotum 1.16–1.23 (mean 1.19, n=3) times as wide as head, 1.31–1.36 (mean 1.33) times as wide as long, basal margin a little convex backwards or its straight medial part slightly surpassing lateral parts, these oblique and increasingly curved forwards; sides sinuate or barely so before obtuse or highly obtuse hind angles. Front transverse impression obliterate, basal transverse impression rather deep, wide, deeper laterally, forming a rather deep, oblique pit at bottom of fairly large basal fovea which is separated from disc by a paralateral line traceable in basal half to two thirds. Both basal and <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->anterior borders entire. Transverse rugosities rather dense and sharp, more so in basal foveae. Punctation invisible or very sparse along reflexed side margin only.</p>
                    <p>Elytra rather convex, 1.47–1.55 (mean 1.52) times as long as wide, 1.77–1.89 (mean 1.84) times as wide as pronotum, apices truncate and a little obtuse; apical truncature conspicuously sinuate before rather distinct though obtusely rounded outer angles. Striae indistinctly crenulate, intervals subequally wide and almost flat. Last abdominal sternite quadrisetose in female.</p>
                    <p>Penis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 21</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">27</xref>) with a very large, triangular, apical lamella (the penis is poorly sclerotized because of an immature condition of the only male examined). Female gonocoxite and gonosubcoxite IX stout, the former with strong ensiform setae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 39</xref>).

                    <p>This species is close to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius wrasei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and perhaps also <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius pahangensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with which it shares such characters as similar body shape and elytral color pattern, as well as a conspicuous dorsal microsculpture. Yet it differs from both in the larger body, entirely black abdomen and strongly reduced, almost indistinct, DLS, from the former also in the smaller eyes with oblique genae, the more convex elytra and a particular structure of both male and female genitalia.

                    <p>Similar to the previous species, except for as follows: body smaller, 7.2–8 mm in length. No bronzed luster over elytral dark pattern, DSS rounded and occupying intervals 1 to 4 and usually also expanded onto 5th, DLS much larger, triangular, on intervals 7 and 8, terminating one forth and three fifths from base and apex, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 9</xref>). Pale color more strongly developed on ventral surface, including metacoxae, metaventrite mesal to the line between mesocoxa and outer tip of metacoxa, as well as sides of first three abdominal sternites. Microsculpture rather sharp throughout.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eyes larger, together with short genae more convex, semicircular in outline, head broadest level to about middle of eye tubercle length; usually two, long, frontal carinae on each side and a weak outer one. Vertex fairly flat, neck-constriction almost indistinct.</p>
                    <p>Pronotum 1.2–1.26 (mean 1.24, n=3) times as wide as head, 1.34–1.4 (mean 1.37) times as wide as long, basal margin slightly and regularly convex backwards or with <!--PageBreak-->medial part slightly surpassing lateral ones, these being oblique forwards and nearly straight; sides barely to distinctly sinuate before obtuse to subrectangular and rather sharp hind angles. Front transverse impression obliterate or very shallow, basal transverse impression rather shallow as well, a rather deep pit at bottom of fairly large basal fovea, paralateral line hardly traceable in basal third. Basal border entire, anterior border interrupted medially. Transverse rugosities dense and fairly sharp throughout, sparser and shallower only in the middle of disc. Punctation absent from disc and almost so over reflexed side margins.</p>
                    <p>Elytra rather flat, 1.47–1.53 (mean 1.5) times as long as wide, 1.70–1.77 (mean 1.73) times as wide as pronotum.</p>
                    <p>Penis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 19</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">25</xref>, apical lamella fairly long, parallel-sided, widely rounded at tip; left paramere with a short and widely rounded apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 33</xref>). Female gonocoxite and gonosubcoxite IX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 40</xref>) more slender, and with smaller ensiform setae than in the previous species.

                    <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Kirschenhofer (2010)</xref>, this species is barely different from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Taridius pahangensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Pahang, Malay Peninsula, mainly in a sharper dorsal microsculpture. If so, the latter species may have two or three frontal carinae on each side of the head instead of only one as specified originally.<!--PageBreak-->
