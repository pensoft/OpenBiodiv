                <p>Based on small samples (exemplars) analyzed with morphological methods, including detailed descriptions and illustrations, this study treats primarily the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group in the Western Hemisphere, which comprises two precinctive genera: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> Gnaspini, Vanin &amp; Godoy, 1998 (type species <italic><tp:taxon-name>Parazuphium tessai</tp:taxon-name></italic> Godoy &amp; Vanin, 1990) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>gen. n.</bold> (type species <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium mexicanum</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chaudoir, 1863). The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> includes six troglobitic species from Brazilian caves, and one probably hypogaeic (troglophilic) species from the mountains of Oaxaca, in Mexico (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium whiteheadi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <bold>sp. n.</bold>, type locality, ridge top, in western Oaxaca, Mexico, at 2164 m, 35 km north of San Pedro Juchatengo, <named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates" xlink:type="simple">16.462N, 97.010W</named-content>). The epigaeic genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> includes 23 species, with its geographical range extended from Neotropical temperate Argentina in southern South America, northward through the tropics to north temperate southeastern Canada, in the Nearctic Region.

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The taxonomic investigation reported herein, began with discovery of an undescribed Mexican species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> Gnaspini, Vanin &amp; Godoy. Considering that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> was known previously only from caves in eastern Brazil, its known range extension into the northern part of Middle America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Map 1</xref>) was reason to examine it closely, with the expectation of broadening our concept of the genus, and perhaps even of its tribe, the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
            <p>Although the six known Brazilian species had been clearly described and well illustrated, a more detailed comparison of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> with other zuphiines seemed desirable. Closer comparisons with the geographically widespread, morphologically similar <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> of authors were undertaken, beginning with a sampling of the Western Hemisphere species, and extending into the Eastern Hemisphere taxa, principally those from Western Europe and eastern Africa, with emphasis on the wide-ranging <italic>olens</italic> species group.</p>
            <p>We broadened our study by placing <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see below) in the context of a short review, based on the literature, of the Western Hemisphere zuphiine genera. We also took into account the classification of the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name> (see Appendix I).</p>

                <p>This study is based on examination of 94 specimens of <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiina</tp:taxon-name>, from the Western Hemisphere Nearctic and Neotropical Regions, and Eastern Hemisphere Palaearctic, Afrotropical, and Oriental Regions. Much of the material was in the Strickland Museum, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta (UASM). Through the generosity of Terry L. Erwin, a sampling of zuphiines was received from the Department of Entomology, United States National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., U.S.A. 20560 (USNM).</p>

                <p>Measurements. Measurements were made with an ocular micrometer in a Wild M5 stereoscopic microscope, at 50×. Measurements of external body parts and abbreviations used for them in the text are:</p>

                <p>To express quantitatively proportions of the phallus, three measurements were made, using left lateral and dorsal aspects as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figs 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>:</p>
                <p><abbrev>PL<def><p> Length of phallus - measured in a straight line from basal to apical margin;</p></def></abbrev></p>
                <p><abbrev>PAL<def><p> Length of apical portion - measured in a straight line from apical margin of periostial area to apical margin;</p></def></abbrev></p>
                <p><abbrev>PSW<def><p> Width of phallus - maximum transverse distance across the shaft, in ventral aspect.</p></def></abbrev></p>
                <p>These measurements were combined as two ratios PAL/PL; and PSW/PL. These numerical data are illustrative rather than definitive.</p>
                <p>Preparation of material. Dissections were made by using standard techniques. Genitalia and other small structures were preserved in glycerine in microvials and pinned beneath the specimens from which they were removed. Larger structures and those that were gold-coated for study with the SEM were glued to cards pinned beneath the specimens from which they were removed.</p>
                <p>Micrographs of isolated structures were taken with a JEOL JSM 6301 FXV field emission SEM. Line drawings of selected body parts were prepared by using a camera lucida on a Wild W5 stereoscopic microscope. Plates were prepared by using Adobe Photoshop CS 4.</p>

                <p>Label data. For type material, the information on each label is reproduced as exactly as is possible using ordinary type. Information on each label is enclosed in quotation marks; as well, a semicolon marks the end of a label. A slash mark (/) indicates the end of each line of text.</p>

                <title>Terms
                Structural features</title>
                <p>Most of the terms used to designate details of structures are found in textbooks of general entomology, or are used by coleopterists, generally. Other words, used to designate particular structures or parts thereof, are not in general use, though they have been used by us in previous publications. We provide information about these words here, as well as names that have been changed for certain structural features.</p>
                <p>Microsculpture. A “sculpticell” is the space on the surface of the cuticle enclosed by adjacent microlines of the integumental system of microsculpture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Allen and Ball 1980</xref>: 485-486). In most groups, overall, microsculpture is varied. In contrast, in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> speciesgroup, it is absent (surface smooth) or simply isodiametric, with microlines very fine and sculpticells flat to slightly granulate. Emphasis is placed on description of microsculpture of the sclerites of the dorsal surface, which is adequate for characterization of the taxa of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group.</p>
                <p>Chaetotaxy. This term refers to the so-called “fixed setae”, which are the long, evidently tactile, commonly encountered setae on carabids: dorsal labral; clypeal; supraorbital; stipital; submental; mental; glossal; palpigeral; pronotal; elytral parascutellar, discal, and umbilicate (or lateral); coxal, trochanteral, femoral, and tarsomeral; abdominal sternal ambulatory (sterna IV, V, VI); and abdominal sternal terminal (sternum VII, near posterior margin). Standard leg setae were not included because of difficulty in distinguishing them from the general body setation; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Pellegrini and Ferreira (2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2011b</xref>).</p>
                <p>Body parts. The term “segment” is restricted for use to those body parts that reflect embryonic somites; thus, somite-like portions of the abdomen are referred to as segments. Abdominal segments are designated by Roman numerals corresponding to their respective somites. The first complete sternum is III, and the last one normally exposed is VII. For numbering the genital somites, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bils (1976)</xref>.</p>
                <p>Head. The term “head capsule” in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group is restricted to that portion of the head that extends from the anterior margin of the clypeus to the broad part of the occiput that precedes the more or markedly narrowed posterior part of occiput + postocciput.</p>
                <p>Eyes. Three conditions are recognized in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group: normal size (macrophthalmous), readily seen, convex, with distinct ommatidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>); small (microphthalmous), virtually flat, without ommatidia, not readily seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>); and absent (anophthalmous).</p>
                <p>Antennae. Antennomere 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4B, 4D</xref>) exhibits two or three types of trichoid setae, based on size and declination: <bold>as1</bold>, single, erect, long; <bold>as2</bold>, row of several, erect, moderately long; and <bold>as3</bold>, more or less numerous, short, decumbent.</p>
                <p>Mandibles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Shpeley and Ball (2001</xref>: 9–21, figs 3A–E) characterized the mandibles of the lebiine subtribe <tp:taxon-name>Pericalina</tp:taxon-name>, and illustrated the major features with SEM figures. We use the same system here. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6A–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A–F</xref>.</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p>Labium. The labium of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group is standard for <tp:taxon-name>Carabidae</tp:taxon-name>. For the combined glossae and paraglossae, we use the standard term ligula. The central sclerotized, apically setigerous, structure is the glossal sclerite. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 8C and 8F</xref>.</p>
                <p>Male tarsal vestiture. Two types of adhesive vestiture on the ventral surface of the fore tarsi are exhibited by males of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group: articulo-setae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>, <bold>as</bold>) and biseriate squamo-setae (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Stork 1980</xref>, for a thorough discussion of this topic).</p>
                <p>Male genitalia. Based on economy of expression, in preference to the widely used terms “median lobe” and “internal sac”, we use “phallus” and “endophallus”, respectively. Such usage is also well established in the entomological literature treating the male reproductive system. The surface of the phallus treated by convention as dorsal is really the ventral surface, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Deuve 1993</xref>: 88). As in our previous publications, we have chosen to remain with the conventional usage. Phalli were classified as anopic, with the ostium dorso-medial. The phallus (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figs 10A–10F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13A–13C</xref>), illustrated in left lateral, ventral and right lateral aspects, with base toward the bottom of the page, exhibits interspecific differences in form. These differences are seen readily as overall patterns (‘Gestalt’) but are not so easily described, except with notation of differences in size and shape of the apical area. To provide the basis for verbal description, two principal regions are distinguished-- the shaft (<bold>s</bold>), and basal bulb (<bold>bb</bold>), or lobe, or phallobase. The latter is the swollen area set at an angle to the ventrally curved shaft, surrounding the basal opening; the periostial membrane (<bold>om</bold>), which surrounds the ostium, marks the place of egress of the endophallus during copulation; an apical portion (<bold>ap</bold>) or phalloapex, extends distally from the apex of the periostial membrane to the apex of the phallus. The phalli in lateral aspect exhibit curvature ventrally. A pair of slender paraostial sclerites (<bold>ps</bold>) is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figs 13A, 13C</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10A</xref>).</p>
                <p>Ovipositor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figs 11A–11F</xref>) andfemale genital tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 12A, 12B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13D</xref>). For naming the sclerites of the adephagan ovipositor and units of the female genital tract, we follow the system used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Liebherr and Will (1998</xref>; see figures therein). For the gonocoxites (<bold>gc1</bold>, <bold>gc2</bold>), the surfaces that are ventral in the infolded position are lateral when the ovipositor is extended; thus such surfaces are designated as lateral, and the other surfaces are designated accordingly.</p>

            <p>Some of the morphological features that distinguish <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the Eastern Hemisphere widespread <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium olens</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group (includes <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium olens</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Rossi, 1790), type species of the genus) are shared with the Western Hemisphere species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> of authors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). From that distribution of character states, we conclude that the Western Hemisphere <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> of authorsforms an assemblage different from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> andfromthe <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium olens</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group, and this bridges the morphological gap between those two taxa. A reasonable taxonomic expression of this situation seems to us is to recognize three groups of generic rank: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<italic>sensu stricto</italic>), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>new genus</bold> (= <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> of auothors), and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

Members of those species occupying the caves in limestone substrate are described as freely walking over the soil, and presumably resting exposed, rather than resting (hiding?) under rock cover. In contrast, all of the specimens collected of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium tapiaguassu</tp:taxon-name></italic> were found under rocks, on the cave floor. In contrast, known members of the Mexican species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium whiteheadi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, seem to be surface inhabitants (see below)</p>

                        <p>The ultrastructural features (i.e., principally sensillar) observed with scanning electron microscopy by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Pellegrini and Ferreria (2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2011b</xref>) differ only slightly between the two species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> that they studied, and between that genus and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (cf. accompanying SEM illustrations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides mexicanum</tp:taxon-name></italic>). So, it seems to us unlikely that such features are or will be evolutionarily informative.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, the standard structural troglobitic features of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> (lengthening of antennae and legs, depigmentation, micro- or anophthalmy, and reduction of elytral length, elytral humeri, metathorax and metathoracic wings) plus details of male and female genitalia are evolutionarily informative. Based on eye loss and more elongate appendages, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gnaspini et al. (1998</xref>: 303) proposed that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium cessaima</tp:taxon-name></italic> showed the more modified features, compared to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium tessai</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium bezerra</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the only other species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> known at that time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Álvares and Ferreira (2002</xref>: 43) proposed that, based on the features noted above, their newly described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium pains</tp:taxon-name></italic> would occupy a position intermediate between <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium cessaima</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium tessai</tp:taxon-name></italic> + <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium bezerra</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

                        <p>The external features of <!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> evidently evolved in parallel with, and independent of, four other zuphiine troglobite taxa: the remarkable Spanish <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ildobates neboti</tp:taxon-name></italic> Español, 1966; the Canary Islands <italic><tp:taxon-name>Parazuphium feloi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Machado (1997: 163); the Australian Nullarbor <italic><tp:taxon-name>Speozuphium poulteri</tp:taxon-name></italic> Moore (1995: 159) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Speothalpius grayi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Moore (1995: 160). Another Canary Islands <italic><tp:taxon-name>Parazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Parazuphium damascenum canariense</tp:taxon-name></italic> Machado, 1992: 580) exhibits these same reductive (though less developed) features, but it is evidently conspecific with the continental Palaearctic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Parazuphium damascenum damascenum</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Fairmaire, 1897). For a more detailed discussion of the matter see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Machado (1992</xref>: 581–582).</p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gnaspini et al. (1998</xref>: 308–309) proposed for the Brazilian species of <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> that “..... these highly derived troglobitic features are due to a long-term <!--PageBreak-->isolation inside the subterranean environments, which took place under the drier climate to which the region was in the past and is still submitted in the present. It is largely accepted in the literature that cave arthropods are related to litter epigean and/or endogean ancestors, which already inhabited humid habitats. Therefore,... ... the ancestral species [of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic>] should have been epigean and lived in forested (or at least humid) areas, and occurred at least in part of the region where the genus occurs nowadays. From [such ancestral stock] several lineages invaded the caves from the northern Bambui Speleological Province, where they became isolated with the progressive shrinkage of humid environments. Thence, the origin of the genus takes back to a time when the area was not drying yet, which is probably the Tertiary”.</p>
                        <p>Discovery of the Mexican species adds important details to the story of evolution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic>. First, the marked geographical range extension (from southeastern South America to the southern part of the North American continent) shows that this genus was not confined to eastern Brazil. Further, the distribution pattern lends support to the hypothesis of Gnaspini et. al. (see above) that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> originated in early Tertiary time (i.e., before the beginning of the drying trend that extended through much of the Cenozoic era). Second, the extra-speleal humid forest existence of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium whiteheadi</tp:taxon-name></italic> suggests that the basic troglobitic features of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> (microphthalmy, brachyptery, depigmentation, etc.) evolved in surface habitats, though probably in forested deep leaf litter locations, and were in effect preadaptations for cave life.</p>
                        <p>An additional observation relating to evolutionary history of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus groupis that shared features of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> indicate that these two genera may be adelphotaxa, with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> retaining mostly ancestral features including life in lowland hygrophilous or mesophilous situations.</p>

                        <p>The specimens from the type locality were collected in the remains of a cloud forest. One was on the ground, in leaf litter; using a Bowie knife, the other was dug out of wet wood of a pine log, near the ground surface. The Monte Alban specimen was likely taken from a dark crevice, “where the temperature was much cooler than outside“ (Rolf Aalbu, personal communication). Judging from the structural features of the type material, this species may be troglophilic, but not troglobitic, as are its Brazilian congeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gnaspini et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Pellegrini and Ferreira 2011b</xref>).</p>

            <title>Concluding remarks</title>
            <p>Treatment of the Western Hemisphere zuphiines remains incomplete. The large geographical gap between the Brazilian and Mexican species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Coarazuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> causes one to wonder just how large the gap is. Surely, considering that this genus is likely to be an old (early Tertiary) resident of the Middle American highlands, we can expect therein additional species.</p>
            <p>At hemisphere level, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphioides</tp:taxon-name></italic> must be reviewed in detail, using as the principal basis the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Joaquin Mateu (1981)</xref>. No doubt, many more species remain to be discovered and described. From a World perspective, a generic-subtribal revision of the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name> is required, based primarily on structural details of the male and female reproductive organs.</p>

                <title>Tribe <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name> in the Western Hemisphere
                Nature of the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name></title>
                <p>Based on morphological features, most authors have treated the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name> as a “natural” group, meaning in phylogenetic parlance that it is essentially monophyletic. But a molecular analysis, based on two nuclear genes (28S rDNA and <italic>wingless</italic>) conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ober and Maddison (2008</xref>: 8, fig. 2) indicated otherwise, namely that this tribe is polyphyletic, its constituent genera having emerged on four different lines, though all of these are within the supertribe <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiitae</tp:taxon-name>. However, the Ober/Maddison sample included only a small part of zuphiine diversity, and sequences from only two genes. The limited taxon sampling is especially problematic given the large divergences between DNA sequences within <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiitae</tp:taxon-name>. In addition, the bootstrap values for this result were low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ober and Maddison 2008</xref>: 6, fig. 1). We choose to continue treating the tribe as a practical taxonomic unit, with the hope that a more extensive sample of both zuphiite taxa and genes will give a different result, namely confirming the monophyly of the morphologically based <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

                <p>Specimens of this tribe are small in size (overall length less than 7.00 mm), integument various (nearly white, testaceous to piceous), and generally pilose, head more or less constricted posteriorly, antennomere 1 (scape) elongate more than length of antennomeres 2+3 and wider than antennomeres 2-11; elytra with apical margin truncate, or subtruncate-sinuate, with a narrow membranous fringe; elytral interval 3 without fixed setae; tibiae without prominent spines. For a more detailed characterization of <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Jeannel (1942</xref>: 1091–1092).</p>

                <title>Classification</title>
                <p>Based on previous studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Reichardt (1977</xref>: 448) included five Western Hemisphere genera in the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name>, which he arranged in two subtribes: <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiina</tp:taxon-name> (<!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> Latreille, 1805) and <tp:taxon-name>Patriziina</tp:taxon-name> (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Pseudaptinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Laporte de Castelnau, 1835; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Thalpius</tp:taxon-name></italic> LeConte, 1851; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chaudoir, 1862; and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Metaxidius</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chaudoir, 1852). A third subtribe (<tp:taxon-name>Leleupidiina</tp:taxon-name>), with genera known only from the Old World tropics, was recognized but not treated further. To these, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Mateu (1992)</xref> added the monogeneric <tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalina</tp:taxon-name>, placing therein the Neotropical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chaudoir. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Mateu (1982)</xref> had added the Neotropical monobasic genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chaudoirella</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mateu, including it in the <tp:taxon-name>Patriziina</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Lorenz (2005</xref>: 504–507) recognized only three subtribes, namely <tp:taxon-name>Leleupidiina</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dicrodontina</tp:taxon-name>, (a monogeneric group proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Machado (1992</xref>: 569)), and <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiina</tp:taxon-name>, including in the last-named the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiina</tp:taxon-name> of authors, <tp:taxon-name>Patriziina</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalina</tp:taxon-name>. We accept provisionally the Lorenz proposal of three subtribes, but recognize genus-groups within the <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiina</tp:taxon-name>. For the Western Hemisphere, we recognize the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Zuphium</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group, the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Patrizia</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group (the latter name proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alluaud 1931</xref>, a junior synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Agastus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Schmidt-Goebel, 1846), and, the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalus</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group. Based on marked similarities in the female genitalia, we place <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chaudoirella</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Mateu 1992</xref>: 196, fig. 1H; cf. fig. 199, fig. 3A) in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Mischocephalus</tp:taxon-name></italic> genus-group. We note also that the marked divergence in structure of the male genitalia and female ovipositor between the members of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Agastus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pseudaptinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> + <italic><tp:taxon-name>Thalpius</tp:taxon-name></italic> suggest that the latter might best be placed in a supraspecific group of their own.</p>
                <p>The following key distinguishes among the Western Hemisphere genus-groups and genera of <tp:taxon-name>Zuphiini</tp:taxon-name>. Note that among other recent authors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Messer (2011</xref>: 419-424) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bousquet (2012</xref>: 1359) treat <italic><tp:taxon-name>Thalpius</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pseudaptinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> as subgenera of genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pseudaptinus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Messer (2011)</xref> provides a key to the Mexican-USA species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Thalpius</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
