            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pic, 1916 is a distinctive but relatively uniform genus of Neotropical <tp:taxon-name>Ciidae</tp:taxon-name>, recently redescribed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade (2007)</xref> and currently including two species: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis opacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pic, 1916, from French Guyana and northern Brazil; and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Lopes-Andrade, 2007, an endangered species occurring in small remnants of the Brazilian <!--PageBreak-->Atlantic Forest in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Bahia. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species are not frequently collected and few specimens are known from museum collections.
            </p>
            <p>The aims of this work are to provide new records and comparative notes on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, descriptions of three additional species of the genus and an updated identification key for the species.

            <title>Material and methods</title>
            <p>Slide preparations of male terminalia, and methods for photographing slide preparations and specimens, followed mostly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Lopes-Andrade (2011)</xref>, except for the stereosmicroscope and camera used, a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C and a Canon EOS 1000D attached, respectively. Terms for external morphology of ciids are explained and discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Lopes-Andrade and Lawrence (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Lopes-Andrade (2008)</xref>. It must be emphasized that “tegmen”, as used here, is synonymous with “paramere”, “parameral piece” or “apicale” and not with the same term as used in <tp:taxon-name>Cucujoidea</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Chrysomeloidea</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Curculionoidea</tp:taxon-name>, which is essentially synonymous with phallobase or basal piece (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Lawrence and Lopes-Andrade 2010</xref>). The terms “low”, “medium” and “high” (or “minor”, “intermediate” and “major”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Scott 1926</xref>) refers to the conspicuousness of secondary sexual characters in male head and pronotum of ciids. Low males are the ones with the weakest horns and/or tubercles, being barely discernible from females. In medium males, these features are conspicuous but not developed at their most. High males have the most prominent horns and/or tubercles. Such variation in male development is common in ciids and usually seen as two categorical forms, low and high, in species known from few localities and/or small series (e.g. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cis pickeri</tp:taxon-name></italic> Lopes-Andrade et al. and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xylographus seychellensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Scott; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Lopes-Andrade et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Scott 1926</xref>) and seen as a continuum in widely distributed and frequently collected ciids (e.g. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ceracis cornifer</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mellié; Lopes-Andrade pers. obs.). The new species described here were compared to named specimens of both described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, and all type specimens were examined. Images of all described and new species are provided, but images of male terminalia of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis opacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade (2007)</xref> and not repeated here. The identification key was elaborated to work for both male and female specimens. However, it is not advisable to identify any <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> based on female specimens alone, since secondary sexual characters and male terminalia are important features for recognizing species.
            </p>
            <p>Range, mean and standard deviation are given for measurements and ratios. Measurements of antennomeres were taken from the holotypes. The following abbreviations are used for measurements and ratios: CL, length of the antennal club; EL, elytral length (median length from base of scutellum to elytral apex); EW, greatest elytral width; FL, length of the antennal funicle; GD, greatest depth of the body; PL, pronotal length along midline (including the anterior pronotal plate in males); PW, greatest pronotal width; TL, total length (EL+PL; head not included). The ratio GD/EW was taken as an indication of degree of convexity; TL/EW indicates degree of body elong<!--PageBreak-->ation. Values for TL and TL/EW of the type series of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the unique available male <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis opacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> are also provided here, since in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade (2007)</xref> TL included the length of the head seen from above. Each description is based on the holotype, which is a fully pigmented male. Differences among paratypes are given in the section on “Variation”, together with standard measurements and ratios of the type series.
            </p>
            <p>The distribution map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 41</xref>) was created using latitude and longitude coordinates estimated by tracking localities in the freeware Google Earth 6.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Google Earth 2011</xref>) and plotting them in a map using the freeware DIVA-GIS 7.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Hijmans et al. 2001</xref>).

In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis opacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the epipleura is much more enlarged, easily visible from above, with external margin crenulate; the male eighth<!--PageBreak--> sternite is similar, but basal piece is strongly developed and is almost half the length of aedeagus; tegmen is elongate, four times as long as wide.

Ratios: PL/PW 0.83; EL/EW 1.00; EL/PL 1.24; GD/EW 0.87; TL/EW 1.84. Body oblong, strongly convex, mostly light yellowish brown; mouthparts and apices of femora reddish brown; ventral vestiture consisting of very fine decumbent setae. Head strongly developed, the anterior and lateral margins easily visible from above; dorsum concave, slightly tumid on disc; punctation relatively fine, shallow, sparse; in between punctures finely granulate; frontoclypeal ridge explanate, each side produced upward forming a conspicuous horn that is slightly arcuate, bearing two small tubercles between them; each side of vertex explanate and produced laterally forming a conspicuous triangular plate with an acute apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 13</xref>, arrows). Eyes coarsely facetted; greatest width 0.18mm. Each antenna (left antenna measured; FL 0.22mm; CL 0.23mm; CL/FL 1.05) with length of antennomeres (in mm) as follows: 0.12; 0.07; 0.08; 0.04; 0.04; 0.03; 0.03; 0.06; 0.06; 0.11. Pronotum with shallow, coarse, single punctation; punctures separated by a distance about a puncture-width; in between punctures smooth at disc and finely granulate at the anterior projection; vestiture indistinctly dual, consisting of conspicuous yellowish stout erect bristles (~0.05mm) and very fine decumbent setae (&lt;0.02mm); anterior angles broadly rounded, just slightly produced forward; anterior margin (beyond anterior angles) explanate, produced forward forming a plate that slightly curves downward and narrows toward a slightly arcuate apex with a row of very long slender setae (&gt;0.35mm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 10, 12</xref>, arrows). Scutellum subtriangular; punctation finer than those of pronotum and elytra; vestiture consisting of stout decumbent bristles (better seen in lateral view); basal width 0.21mm. Hindwings fully developed. Elytra subparallel at basal two-thirds, with posterolateral angles broadly rounded (as seen from above) and then converging to a blunt apex; punctation single and confused, a bit sparser than that of <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->pronotum; in between punctures smooth; vestiture indistinctly dual, consisting of conspicuous stout erect bristles (~0.07mm) and very minute decumbent setae (&lt;0.02mm); lateral and apical margins not visible from above; epipleura tapering from base to apex.

Each antenna (left antenna measured; FL 0.30mm; CL 0.28mm; CL/FL 0.93) with length of antennomeres (in mm) as follows: 0.15; 0.09; 0.08; 0.08; 0.06; 0.05; 0.03; 0.08; 0.08; 0.12. Pronotum with single, coarse, relatively deep punctation; punctures very close to each other, separated by a distance of one puncture-width or less; in between punctures smooth but not shining; vestiture yellowish, indistinctly dual (seen under a magnification of 100×), consisting of stout erect bristles (~0.05mm) and small decumbent setae (~0.03mm), both better seen in lateral view; anterior angles not produced forward; anterior margin (beyond anterior angles) explanate, strongly produced forward forming a plate that slightly curves downward and narrows toward an acute apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 19</xref>, arrow) ornamented by a row of increasingly stout bristles in either side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 17-19</xref>); lateral margins slightly crenulate, not visible from above, bearing a row of stout bristles. Scutellum subtriangular, its margins indistinct so that it seems to be contiguous with elytra; punctation conspicuous but slightly finer than those of pronotum and elytra; vestiture consisting of stout decumbent bristles (better seen in lateral view); basal width 0.20mm. Hindwings fully developed. Elytra parallel at basal three-fourths, posteriorly broadly rounded (as seen from above) and converging to a blunt apex; punctation single and confused, slightly finer than that of pronotum, consisting of relatively deep punctures separated by a distance near a puncture-width; in between punctures smooth, dull; vestiture distinctly dual, the erect bristles about 0.1mm long <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->and the decumbent setae about 0.03mm long; lateral and apical margins not visible from above; epipleura tapering from base to the basal one-sixth, then continuing as a narrow line to the apex. Ventral surfaces of thorax and abdomen finely granulate; vestiture consisting of slender decumbent setae. Prosternum flat; prosternal process laminate, two-thirds the length of the procoxae. First abdominal ventrite more than twice as long as the second at midline; setose sex patch suboval and margined, located at the middle of the ventrite and with a diameter of one-third the length of the ventrite at midline.

Höhn. &amp; Litsch. <!--PageBreak-->(<tp:taxon-name>Hymenochaetacea</tp:taxon-name>). This fungus was previously misidentified as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phellinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Graf-Peters et al. 2011</xref>). After its description, the species was recollected in Viçosa and a single female was found in Santa Maria de Jetibá (in the state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 32</xref>). The species is restricted to forests, known only from small remnants, and was never found in open areas. Specimens from Venda Nova do Imigrante (Espírito Santo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 33</xref>) are reddish, and the ones from Jussari (in the state of Bahia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 34</xref>) are dark brown. In low males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 30</xref>), the frontoclypeal and pronotal projections are very weak and the pronotum narrower anteriorly. TL (in mm, not including the head) and TL/EW of the type series are as follows: Males (n = 10, including the holotype), TL 2.00–2.80 (2.25 ± 0.22), TL/EW 1.54–1.81 (1.64 ± 0.07); Females (n = 5), TL 2.00–2.35 (2.14 ± 0.14), TL/EW 1.48–1.68 (1.60 ± 0.08).<!--PageBreak-->

However, the shallow punctation of pronotum resembles mostly that of the former two species. Female <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Jussari (Brazil) are similar in color, but body is more elongate. It is very large, with a length of near 3mm. Only females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis occultus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. reach such a length. A subquadrate body is also observed in a few <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but the largest females of this species are only 2.4mm long. The very transverse pronotum, twice as long as wide, does not occur in any other known <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species. This female from Peru possibly belongs to another new species, but description is not possible without examining a male. Measurements (in mm) and ratios are as follows: TL 3.05; PL 1.00; PW 2.00; EL 2.00; EW 2.11; GD 1.68; PL/PW 0.50; EL/EW 0.95; EL/PL 2.00; GD/EW 0.80; TL/EW 1.45.<!--PageBreak-->

            <p>The phylogenetic position of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is uncertain. In the available phylogenetic analysis of the family, based on molecular data, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> was not part of any defined clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Buder et al. 2008</xref>). It is morphologically related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Miyatake from Japan, with a unique combination of features among <tp:taxon-name>Ciini</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade 2007</xref>): prominent outer apical angle of protibiae, forming an acute tooth; laminate prosternal process; and subconical procoxae. However, these features are also observed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Porculus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Lawrence, in which species also have a very elongate female ovipositor similar to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, male terminalia with tegmen bearing a deep V-shaped emargination and subcylindrical penis (Lopes-Andrade pers. obs). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Porculus</tp:taxon-name></italic> differs from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the single punctation of pronotum and elytra, and dorsal vestiture consisting of minute setae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Lawrence 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade 2007</xref>). A strongly sclerotized female ovipositor devoid of gonostyli was observed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Porculus grossus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Lawrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Lawrence and Lopes-Andrade 2010</xref>), but in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Porculus brunneus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mellié) the structure is complete and less sclerotized, similar to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Porculus</tp:taxon-name></italic> are restricted to the Neotropical region (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Morrone 2002</xref>), and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is known only from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Lawrence and Lopes-Andrade 2010</xref>). These three genera possibly constitute an independent lineage of <tp:taxon-name>Ciinae</tp:taxon-name>.
            </p>
            <p>Species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are not frequently collected and all are allopatric. They are known only from forests or forest remnants and usually one or few specimens are found together in the field. The greatest series is that for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis occultus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., which was reared in laboratory. Accurate data on host fungi are scarce. Available information on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> suggests the species is monophagous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Graf-Peters et al. 2011</xref>). It was considered an endangered species by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lopes-Andrade (2007)</xref>. However, not only this species but possibly all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are seriously threatened or endangered. For instance, besides great collection efforts in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Graf-Peters et al. 2011</xref>) and in an unpublished<!--PageBreak--> survey in Pará, northern Brazil (Lopes-Andrade pers. obs.), no <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis</tp:taxon-name></italic> was collected. Most of the recent records (from 2000 up to know) are from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, from small remnants in southeastern and the most southern portion of northeastern Brazil. The single old record of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Falsocis occultus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. from Nova Teutônia, in the state of Santa Catarina, suggests the species would have had a very broad distribution throughout the Atlantic Forest. This biome has been seriously affected and fragmented by land use and urbanization, and less than 8% of the original forests still remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Colombo and Joly 2010</xref>).
