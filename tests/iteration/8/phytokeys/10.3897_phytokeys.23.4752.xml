        <p>A checklist of the flora of Chad has been compiled by the authors, based on literature, on-line data-bases, herbarium collections and land surveys (1998-2011). It counts 2,460 records, i.e. 2,288 species (including 128 autonyms), 83 subspecies, 81 varieties, 8 forms, while all the previous available information reported 1,600 species.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant diversity provides numerous essential services to society. These include material goods (for example, food, timber, medicines, and fiber), ecosystem functions (flood control, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling), and nonmaterial benefits such as recreation. Plant diversity contributes to agriculture (wild crops relatives) and forestry, pro<!--PageBreak-->vides carbon storage and sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</xref> 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Power 2010</xref>). Plant diversity and biodiversity in general also secure long-term flows of benefits from nature by providing resilience to disturbance and environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Maestre et al. 2012</xref>). These and other economic and social contributions are substantial, with recent estimates claiming that the economic value of benefits from biodiverse natural ecosystems may be 10 to 100 times the cost of maintaining them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Rands et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>The floristic inventory of a region or country is a very first basis, a necessary prerequisite for assessing plant diversity and for much fundamental research in botany and plant ecology, such as modeling patterns of species diversity or understanding species distribution and highlights key conservation issues.</p>
      <p>The studies on the flora and vegetation in Chad started around the ‘50s with the relevant pioneer contributions of R. Corti, H. Gillet, R. Maire and P. Quézel. Although their great efforts and fundamental contributions posed the basis of the knowledge of flora and vegetation in Chad, botanical exploration has been not yet reasonably comprehensive, the more recent (partial) checklists and maps are mainly dated to the ‘70s (see references cited therein) and an updated flora, or even an updated country checklist are lacking. Botanical studies has been interrupted for a long period, also due to the civil war, with the result that the available base of knowledge is quite dated and limited to a few regions of the Country. As a result, Chad is one of the African countries whose flora and vegetation are less studied and known. Chad territory is greatly extended in latitude, several climatic zones and vegetation belts are found, along with very different peculiar habitats and land uses, and therefore significant biodiversity richness is to be reasonably expected.</p>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Davis et al. (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Stuart and Adams (1990)</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Keith and Plowes (1997)</xref>, there are about 1,600 species of vascular plants in Chad, of which 1,516 occur south of about 16 N latitude. This is expected to be a very low number considering the land size and the diverse climatic conditions in Chad. The Tibesti Mountains are estimated to have about 450 species of plants, with a mix of Mediterranean, Saharan, Sahelian and afromontane elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Davis et al. 1986</xref>). Lacking additional further studies, these figures (1,600 species) were confirmed later in the comprehensive work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Frodin (2001)</xref> on standards Flora of the word and in several reviews on global plant diversity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Davis et al. 1994–1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Groombndge and Jenkins 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Pitman and Jørgensen 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>During the years 1998-2011 the Department of Botany of the University of Sassari, in collaboration with the University of N’Djamena have investigated the flora and vegetation of Chad, with land surveys and literature and herbaria research and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Camarda et al. 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Camarda and Brundu 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The present checklist of the Flora of Chad has been compiled as a first step to making more accessible the data collected and still unpublished, or already published but little known, in order to facilitate subsequent taxonomic work and further botanical research and biodiversity conservation planning. In fact, the literature is much dispersed and is often difficult to access because most of the papers are relatively old and/or were published in regional or national journals which are not readily available.</p>

        <p>Chad is a medium-size, land-locked African country, with low population (1,284,000 km<sup>2</sup>, more then 7 millions of habitants, density 4.9 habitants/km<sup>2</sup>, with more than 1 million people living in the capital). The Sahelian and Ennedi regions are mainly disabitated (0.1 habitants/km<sup>2</sup>) yet subject to unpredictable and variable pressure of nomads. Most of the population is concentrated in the Southern part of the Country, i.e. around lake Chad basin, Chari and Logone floodplains (54), and in the urban areas of N’Djamena, Bongor, Moundou and Sarh. Chad territory is greatly extended in latitude. Average annual rainfall decreases with increasing latitude, from 1,150 mm at Moundou (08°30'N) to 902 mm at Am Timan (11°N), 582 mm at N’Djamena (12°N), 43 mm at Faya-Largeau (18°N) and no reliable rainfall further north (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Scholte and Robertson 2001</xref>). It is important to note that a quite large proportion of the country in the north receives less then 100 mm of rainfall per year, and that 4 of the 5 main African climatic zones are present in Chad, notably hyper-arid (&lt; 100 mm), arid (100–200 mm), semi-arid (200–400 mm), sub-humid dry (400–800) and sub-humid humid (800–1,300 mm).</p>
        <p>The dry season in the south extends from November to March and increases in duration northwards. Reflecting the decreasing south–north rainfall gradient, the vegetation of the country is divided latitudinally into three sub equal zones and a minor fourth in the southern part: the Saharan desert belt in the north (including the Saharomontane vegetation of Tibesti), the Sahelian belt covering the central third (Semi-desert grassland and thorny shrubland to wooded grassland and bushland, with <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="02e4d62e-6260-41a6-bd79-e98b4ba37d62" obkms_process="TRUE">Acacia</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="f6bec596-494c-42e5-8ca5-fe1b6c9f185d" obkms_process="TRUE">Commiphora africana</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="0353297d-5935-498b-8161-fb3456d17cc6" obkms_process="TRUE">Balanites aegyptiaca</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="7638be43-9530-45b4-858c-91019ceefbc1" obkms_process="TRUE">Euphorbiaceae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and abundant dryland taxa), Sudanian belt (woodland and dry forest, with <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="2d310bfd-879b-4462-9937-9fb0ce83ce58" obkms_process="TRUE">Celtis integrifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="fa758ef6-9bc7-4d73-912b-5a876f1c6c07" obkms_process="TRUE">Hymenocardia acida</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="04065034-161b-4b7e-9ce7-c05da25246dc" obkms_process="TRUE">Lannea</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="61714b66-f301-4756-bcc0-4e9cb361a191" obkms_process="TRUE">Prosopis africana</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="6781dc0a-942e-4984-9906-d239784783d5" obkms_process="TRUE">Mytragyna inermis</tp:taxon-name></italic>) in the south and a minor area of Sudano-Guinean vegetation, as a mosaic of dry, peripheral, semi-evergreen rainforest and woodland or secondary grassland, regarded as transitional between the Sudanian and Guineo-Congolian vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Pias 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Olago 2001</xref>). Land uses, land cover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Mayaux et al. 2004</xref>) and agro-ecological zones in Chad, as in the most of Western and Central Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Jalloh et al. 2012</xref>), are closely related to the above cited climatic zones.</p>
        <p>The northern third of the country forms part of the Sahara desert and includes, on the border with Libya, the Tibesti massif which rises to 3,415 m. This volcanic massif is the highest both in Chad and the Sahara. Tibesti covers an area of about 50,000 km² and has an average altitude of over 2,000 m. There are areas of Saharomontane vegetation on the massif which are floristically rich and unrelated to the vegetation <!--PageBreak-->of the surrounding lowlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Maire and Monod 1950</xref>, Bruneau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">de Miré and Quézel 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Scholte and Robertson 2001</xref>) while woody vegetation occurs in some deep gorges. Situated south-east of Tibesti, on the Sudan border, is the Ennedi massif, which rises to 1,450 m with sited of great environmental concern such as Guelta of Archei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Camarda et al. 2004b</xref>). The Sahelian belt occupies the middle third of the country. It is bounded in the west by the banks of Lake Chad, the fourth-largest lake in Africa (between 6° to 24°N and 8° to 24°E) and a trans-boundary Ramsar site of international importance. Approximately half of the lake lies within Chadian borders while the rest is shared between Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. The portion of Lake Chad belonging to Chad is evaluated in 16,481.7 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">COP8 2002</xref>). During the normal period, three types of landscapes are to be seen: the open waters with scarce aquatic vegetation (<italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="c19bfaf2-61e9-4910-a527-4a4ea4c9dfde" obkms_process="TRUE">Nymphaea</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp.), the reed-islands which are islands of vegetation (e.g. <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="a0283b9c-5381-4fb3-b597-e33111694206" obkms_process="TRUE">Cyperus papyrus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="1b543a1b-bcde-4066-be36-38c48c074c4c" obkms_process="TRUE">Phragmites australis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="5cd57e4c-ba6b-4b06-a556-2dc9b111a9c7" obkms_process="TRUE">Aeschynomene</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp.pl.) and the archipelagoes consisting of about a thousand sandy islands corresponding to the dune crests of a settled, partly immerged Erg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Carmouze et al. 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Dupont 1970</xref>, Leveque 1983, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Olivry et al. 1996</xref>). Lake Fitri, the country’s second largest wetland, has been called a miniature lake Chad. This Biosphere Reserve is a shallow lake and completely dried up in 1984-1985 after years of drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Keith and Plowes 1997</xref>). The lake has a productive fishery that is important to the local economy and also a remarkable presence of water birds and interesting vegetation communities, typical of Sahelian wetlands.</p>
        <p>On the opposite side of the country, on the Sudan border, and located to the south of the Ennedi massif, the Ouaddai massif rises to a maximum height of 1,260 m. Much of the area between Lake Chad and the Ouaddai massif is, except for parts of the centre-west where there are large expanses of dunes fringed by xerophytic scrubland, a vast, relatively featureless plain (300–400 m) supporting Sahelian grasslands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Scholte and Robertson 2001</xref>). Much of this area is drained by the seasonal Batha river which originates from streams running westwards from the Ouaddai massif and which ultimately empties into the temporary wetlands around Lake Fitri (<named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates" xlink:type="simple">12°50’N, 17°30’E</named-content>). Indeed, an area of 10 million ha in the transition zone between the southern Sahel and northern Sudan–Guinea is subject to regular seasonal inundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Scholte and Robertson 2001</xref>). Other than the Guéra massif, situated in the centre-north, of which the highest peak reaches 1,613 m, the area is mostly flat, lying mainly between 300 m and 400 m. The main rivers of this zone are the Chari and the Logone, which flow north-westwards and drain into Lake Chad.</p>
        <p>The soils in the West-African region have been surveyed for several years by teams of African and European soil scientists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Charreau (1974)</xref> published the first most exhaustive soil classification for the Sub-Saharan Africa. The West-African soil map was made of 12 classes subdivided into sub-classes, groups and sub-groups, families, series and types of soil. The family was composed of soils originating from the same kind of parent material. The series related to the position of the soil on the toposequence and the types to the texture of the surface horizon. Sub-Saharan Africa was divided into five large zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Charreau 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Fellera et al. 2008</xref>). According to the more recent clas<!--PageBreak-->sification of major soils types of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Panagos et al. 2011</xref>) which follows the WRB system (World Reference Base for Soil Resources) the most common soils in Chad are <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="632a45bc-e0cd-4847-9238-ad81a53385f3" obkms_process="TRUE">Leptosols</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="6aa19ca1-632d-40fc-9f22-fb1faef03f2d" obkms_process="TRUE">Regosols</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="3e017cf9-8330-4b33-bc64-2f8fe2a50c21" obkms_process="TRUE">Arenosols</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the central and northern regions, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="2b64de8b-c36a-41f5-b1ac-c206aa662721" obkms_process="TRUE">Fluvisols</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="786b7ae2-ef5e-4697-a69c-d7616cbf7007" obkms_process="TRUE">Plinthosols</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="133e46a8-9221-4d4b-adf1-8464db4d65e8" obkms_process="TRUE">Planosols</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="93c2dea2-d84d-4ab4-a7be-82e5143a247e" obkms_process="TRUE">Solonchaks</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="d5e2a599-af46-4bd0-a551-7e04d834df2c" obkms_process="TRUE">Vertisols</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the southern part.</p>
        <p>In Chad 83% of the working population is engaged in the production of crops and livestock, primarily for domestic consumption. Only 2% of the land is cultivated, but about 50% is grazed. Cereal grains are the main food crops, while beans, corn, rice, vegetables, dates are important in local areas. Cotton and peanuts are the primary cash crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Arditi 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Keith and Plowes 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Pret 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Stuart and Adams 1990</xref>). The main sustenance crops are rain-fed, cultivated and harvested by hand, and growth without the use of fertilizers and other agrochemicals which are used on rice and cotton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Keith and Plowes 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">FAO/UNEP (1981)</xref> assessment, the total forest surface in Chad in 1980 was composed by 130,000.0 km<sup>2</sup> of open forest, 5,000.0 km<sup>2</sup> of closed forest (in the South), and 30.0 km<sup>2</sup> of plantations (e.g. <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="51f1b738-bfe5-493f-986d-bc8e0504378b" obkms_process="TRUE">Azadirachta indica</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="e8d49b38-c5b2-4f3d-a3ad-bda185991c16" obkms_process="TRUE">Eucalyptus</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp.). These estimates are part of the United Nations Global Environment Monitoring Systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">FAO, 1986</xref>). These values are only indicative, because there has not been any National inventory. More recently Tal (2001) reports differing estimated values, <italic>i.e</italic>. 3,626,000 ha of open forest, 211,000 of closed forest, 9,412,000 ha formations with sparse trees, and 10,192,000 of “thickets” or “bushlands”. Plantations are planned to be increased to reach 10,000 ha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">FAO, 2001</xref>). This last estimates and classification systems seem a little more reliable. The Sahel is characterized by semi-desert grassland, thorn scrub and wooded grassland dominated by <italic><tp:taxon-name obkms_id="c86705a8-e347-4818-af32-5b8fdb81d492" obkms_process="TRUE">Acacia</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp pl.

Trees in and shrubs the Chadian Sahelian belt are important as sources of fuel and timber and are becoming, somewhat belatedly, recognized by foresters and administrators as important sources of such non-wood forest products as food, browse, medicines, fibre, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Wickens 1991</xref>). Desertification is widespread throughout the Sahelian zone and there is no quick fix solution to what is an exceedingly complex ecological, geographical, sociological, political and economic problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Wickens 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>The natural forest of <italic>Gam</italic> stretches over more than 5,500 ha and it is indicated as the largest forest in Chad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Pelloux and Boykas 1997</xref>). Located in the south, it is threatened by the increasing demand for building materials, as a result of the growing urbanization around the main centers. The <italic>Assale</italic> forest is situated in the Sahelian-Sudanese transition area, around lake Chad, about 110 km North of N’Djamena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Boykas et al. 1997</xref>). The growing demand for fuelwood in the capital and the relatively recent arrival of the asphalt road, have aroused concern about the overexploitation of the forest. As in most of Africa, the tree resource base is deteriorating. Population growth is putting heavy pressure not only for fuelwood but also for livestock grazing and crops, and these affects are synergetic with climatic stocasticity. Thus there is a strong need to plan conservation of forest genetic resources both <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>ex situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Tal 1994</xref>) and set up management plan and education activities.</p>

        <title>Land surveys</title>
        <p>Ten main botanical field surveys and additional short visits and excursions, including boat surveys, have been done by the Authors in Chad in period 1998-2011. These land surveys aimed to explore the main protected areas of the Country, and most of the regions and sites of environmental concern [Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti (BET), Ounianga Kebir salt lakes, Faya, Fada, Guelta d’Archei, Kanem, Lake Fitri, Batha, Biltine, Ouaddai, Lake Chad, Chari river, Chari-Baguirmi, Guéra, Salamat, Zakouma National Park, Mayo-Kébbi and Logone flood plain], for more than 20,000 km of tracks. The lack of a reliable road network severely limits the possibility to survey the whole Country. Chad is heavily reliant on its 32,000 km road network for the transport of agricultural goods and for linking its widely-dispersed population. However, only around 300-km of the roads are paved, with the rest consisting of poorly-maintained earth or track. Severe flooding during the rainy season renders these roads impassable. During the botanical surveys remarkable sites or species presence and assemblages have been located by hand held GPS, and specimens collected for a dedicated herbarium.</p>

        <p>It has been assumed that if one plant is synonymised with another, then its distribution data can also be transferred. When names from the source lists have been synonymised, the original names under which taxa were published are included as synonyms and their distribution data (presence/absence for Chad) are shown under the current name.

        <p>Most of the specimens collected and studied by the botanists that performed botanical surveys in the past are actually not in Chad but spread elsewhere, e.g. in Algeria, and have not always been preserved, e.g. in Berlin-Dahlem the collection by Gustav Nachtigal, the first botanist that collected specimens in Chad, was destroyed during the 1943 war, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lebrun et al. 1972</xref>. Important herbaria housing numerous material from Chad are at Dakar (Herbier de l’Institut Français d’Afrique Noire, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Maire and Monod 1950</xref>), at Florence (samples collected by Monterin in 1934, were studied by Roberto Corti and stored in the Erbario dell’Università di Firenze, Italy, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Corti 1942</xref>), at Maisons-Alfort (Institut d’Elevage et de Medicine Veterinarie des Pays Tropicaux, Maisons-Alfort, France, ALF, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lebrun et al. 1972</xref>), at Paris (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle MNHN, Paris, e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Gillet 1968</xref>), at Poznan, Poland (collection by Stanislaw Lisowski stored in the Laboratory and herbarium of tropical plants, A.

Additional information on collection in Chad is also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Hepper and Neate 1971</xref>. Nevertheless, this geographic hindrance to visit different herbaria, is today somewhat reduced thanks to the availability of web pages, such as the one of MNHN of Paris or the ALUKA and JSTOR projects, and thanks to international projects of biodiversity data sharing such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gbif.org</ext-link>/).</p>

      <p>As stated in the introduction, the previous available information on the Flora of Chad reported a number of 1,600 entities (without a clear distinction between the number of species and subspecific entities). Actually the 4 main contributions for southern Chad account in the present checklist for 1,638 records, as follows: 1,520 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lebrun et al. (1972)</xref>, 57, 20, 41 reported, respectively by Lebrun and Gaston in their 3 additions to the original list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lebrun and Gaston 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1986</xref>). We include in the list also 121 records for the Tibesti from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Corti (1942)</xref>, 374 recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Maire and Monod (1950)</xref>, 136 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Scholz (1966)</xref>, 539 records for the Ennedi from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Gillet (1968)</xref>. The other records in the checklist derive therefore from GBIF information, from the other literature sources cited in the methods section, from the authors’ personal observations and from personal communications received for Zakouma National park from P. Poilecot.</p>
      <p>A total number or 2,173 taxa (88.3%) are native to Chad, including 55 (2.2%) endemics, while 274 (11.0%) are alien to Chad, and 13 (0.5%) are considered cryptogenic, i.e. of uncertain status. This represents a considerable updated of the previous <!--PageBreak-->knowledge on the alien flora of Chad that counted for 131 taxa (5.3%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Brundu and Camarda (2004)</xref>.</p>
      <p>The majority of taxa in the checklist are perennials (1388, 56.4%), annuals account for 772 taxa (31.4%) and there are 300 taxa (12.2%) with other types of life histories (biannual, annual or biannual, annual or short-lived perennial and annual or perennial).</p>
      <p>There are 657 therophytes (26.7%), 546 phanerophytes (22.2%), 378 hemicryptophytes (15.4%), 256 chamaephytes (10.4%), 160 geophytes (6.5%), 107 helophytes (4.3%), 104 hydrophytes (4.2%). A total of 252 taxa (10.2%) may have different life forms (e.g. terophytes or chamaephytes) and, in the past, were considered as <italic>plurisaisonnières</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Gillet (1968)</xref>. This author indicated 43 taxa of this type for the Ennedi.</p>
      <p>Assessing biodiversity and understanding mechanisms of its changes are difficult in many areas of Africa because data are incomplete or lacking. Conserving biodiversity in Chad is challenging for several reasons including incomplete knowledge, differing and incomplete conceptual models of main ecological processes, major gaps in ecological and management knowledge, high variability in ecological responses to climate, altered vegetation regimes as a result of land-use history and climate change, and the increasing encroachment of open forest landscapes and several habitats by humans.</p>
      <p>We hopefully expect that our checklist would refuel botanical researches in Chad and constitute a reliable basis for the necessary further studies and nature conservation planning.</p>
