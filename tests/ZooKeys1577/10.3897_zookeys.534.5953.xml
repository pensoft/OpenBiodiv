The intraspecific genetic divergence (mean p-distance) was 4.6 to 5.5% for the Common Barn Owl in comparison with specimens from northern Europe and Australasia and 3.1% for the Short-eared Owl with respect to samples from north America, northern Europe and northern Asia. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three distinctive groups for the Common Barn Owl: (<italic>i</italic>) South America (Chile and Argentina) plus Central and North America, (<italic>ii</italic>) northern Europe and (<italic>iii</italic>) Australasia, and two distinctive groups for the Short-eared Owl: (<italic>i</italic>) South America (Chile and Argentina) and (<italic>ii</italic>) north America plus northern Europe and northern Asia. The level of genetic divergence observed in both species exceeds the upper limit of intraspecific comparisons reported previously for <tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="order">Strigiformes</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name>. Therefore, this suggests that further research is needed to assess the taxonomic status, particularly for the Chilean populations that, to date, have been identified as belonging to these species through traditional taxonomy.</p>

The range of both species extends across several continents. In Chile, these owls are sympatric over most of their geographic range, and are considered opportunistic generalists, feeding mainly on small mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Rau et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Martínez et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Figueroa et al. 2009</xref>). Although the Common Barn Owl and the Short-eared Owl have been widely studied throughout most of their geographic range in Chile, studies have concentrated mainly on ecological aspects, e.g. diet, conservation and habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Raimilla et al. 2012</xref>). In contrast, their levels of genetic divergence in comparison with populations in other geographic ranges, have received little attention. This is especially important given that Chilean populations of both species are peripheral populations in the southern hemisphere whose geographic isolation, as a consequence of the Andean mountains that act as a geographic barrier, may have led to evolutionary divergence.</p>
            <p>The Common Barn Owl includes several subspecies, some of which may represent distinct and endemic species. To date, up to 25 distinct species have been recognized within the <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Tyto</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> complex but the status of many of these forms remains poorly documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Weick 2006</xref>). Based on morphological data, the Common Barn Owl in Chile has been assigned to the subspecies <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Tyto</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">alba</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="subspecies">tuidara</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> (J.E. Gray, 1829) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Figueroa et al. 2014</xref>). In the Short-eared Owl, nine subspecies have been recognized across its geographic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Weick 2006</xref>), of which the subspecies <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Asio</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">flammeus</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="subspecies">suinda</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> (Vieillot, 1817) occurs in Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Figueroa et al. 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, no molecular data supporting the taxonomic identity of the populations of these species in Chile are available yet.</p>
            <p>The <abbrev><def><p>mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I </p></def>(COI)</abbrev> gene is considered a powerful molecular tool for molecular identification (‘barcoding’) of bird species and may also help to clarify taxonomic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hebert et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kerr et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aliabadian et al. 2009</xref>). This gene includes a 648-bp region of the mitochondrial genome that provides reasonably good resolution for identifying animal species, as shown by the fact that deep sequence divergences are found between most closely related pairs of animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Hebert et al. 2003</xref>). Given this property, i.e. its ability to capture species boundaries, this marker has been widely used as a method for identifying species, using a library of sequences linked to taxonomically verified voucher specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007</xref>).</p>
            <p>In this study, we sequenced a 648-bp region of the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> gene of the Common Barn Owl and the Short-eared Owl specimens from southern Chile with the aim of comparing these data with the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequences published for these species from other geographic areas. Given that no major information on genetic divergence of owls from Chile based on the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> gene is available, this study may contribute to clarifying the taxonomic status and evolutionary divergence at regional and global scales.</p>

                <p><abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequences were amplified using the primer pair of BirdF1 (5’-TTCTCCAACCACAAAGACATT GGCAC-3’) and BirdR1 (5’-ACGTGGGAGATAATTCCA AATCCTG-3’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hebert et al. 2004</xref>). PCR amplification was carried out in 50 µL using a reaction mix composed of 10 µL Taq polymerase buffer (1 x), 1 µL of dNTPs (0.2 µM), 1.5 µL of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1.5 mM), 2 µL of each primer (0.4 µM), 0.5 µL of Taq DNA polymerase (0.05 U/ µL) (Kapa Biosystems), 7.5 µL of template DNA (100 ng/µL), and 25.5 µL of distilled water DNAse, RNAse free (Gibco). The thermal cycling was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, annealing temperature of 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels, and prior to sequencing, these were cleaned with QIA quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced on an Applied Biosystems ABI377 automated sequencer. Sequence records were assembled from forward and reverse reads, and aligned and edited using GENEIOUS 4.0.2 software (Biomatters Ltd.).

                <p>Five haplotypes for the Common Barn Owl specimens were observed, considering all studied localities, with haplotype 1 being exclusive to the New World (including Chile), and representing more than half of the individuals in the data set (61.9%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The remaining haplotypes were mostly restricted to a single locality, as were haplotypes 3, 4 and 5, of North America, northern Europe and Australasia, respectively. Of note is that haplotype 2 was exclusive to Chile.</p>

                <p>The nine sequences of Common Barn Owl from Chile showed low levels of sequence divergence, ranging from 0 to 0.2% uncorrected p-value. Similarly, genetic divergence between Common Barn Owls from Chile and those from elsewhere in the New World was low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.2%. In contrast, genetic divergence between Common Barn Owls from Chile and those from northern Europe and Australasia was much higher, with p-values ranging from 4.6 to 5.5%. The <abbrev xlink:title="Maximum Likelihood">ML</abbrev> tree showed a cluster of sequences from the New World (including Chile), with a clear separation of sequences from northern Europe and Australasia; this tree had nodes with high (100%) bootstrap values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). The <abbrev xlink:title="Bayesian Inference">BI</abbrev> tree showed a concordant topology, exhibiting high (0.99–1.00) posterior probability values for each node (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).</p>

                <p>The sequence alignment of the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> gene for Short-eared Owl had 611 positions in one specimen from Chile, and nine representative specimens from other regions (one from Argentina, four from North America, two from northern Europe and two from <!--PageBreak-->northern Asia) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Three haplotypes, defined by 20 variable positions, were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Moreover, in this alignment, 19 positions were parsimony informative, and 17 out of 20 changes were synonymous. The best fit-model of nucleotide substitution was Tamura-Nei (TN93) with 1871.5 Akaike value and parameter estimates for base frequencies of A = 0.2594, T = 0.2507, C = 0.3401 and G = 0.1498, relative substitution rates of AC = 0.0083, AG = 0.2110, AT = 0.0061, CG = 0.0036 and CT = 0.1591, and proportion of invariables sites of 0.9673.</p>
                <p>Three haplotypes were found, with haplotype 1 (n = 2 individuals) being exclusive to Chile and Argentina, haplotype 2 (n = 5) exclusive to North America, northern Europe and northern Asia and haplotype 3 (n = 1) exclusive to northern Europe.</p>
                <p><abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequences from Chile and Argentina were identical. However, sequences from Chile/Argentina were highly divergent (3.1%) from those from North America, northern Europe and northern Asia. The <abbrev xlink:title="Maximum Likelihood">ML</abbrev> and <abbrev xlink:title="Bayesian Inference">BI</abbrev> trees (results not shown) showed one cluster for specimens from Chile and Argentina and another cluster for specimens from North America, northern Europe and northern Asia.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>The three major groups of Common Barn Owls inferred here by means of phylogenetic analysis of <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequences (South America plus North America, Australasia and northern Europe) are similar to those identified in previous phylogenetic studies using other molecular markers (mitochondrial <italic>cyt b</italic> and nuclear <italic>LDHb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Wink et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alaie and Aliabadian 2012</xref>). In particular, these studies observed a consistent separation between the New World and Old World Common Barn Owls. Moreover, this topology is in accordance with a recent study that used the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Nijman and Aliabadian 2013</xref>), where strong evidence of a major divergence between New World (<italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">furcata</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> clade) and Old World (<italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">alba</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> clade) clades was found. The combined DNA evidence is consistent with the recognition of New and Old World Common Barn Owls as two different species (<italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Tyto</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">furcata</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Tyto</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">alba</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic>, respectively) as was originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">König and Weick (2008)</xref>. However, more extensive studies of morphological, molecular and acoustic divergence among New and Old World populations are highly desirable.</p>
            <p>In addition, the genetic distance among the Common Barn Owls from Chile and northern Europe and Australasia, from 4.6 to 5.5%, is not surprising, given that previous studies have also documented high levels of sequence divergence among American and Old World populations of this species, ranging from 5.3 to 7.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alaie and Aliabadian 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Nijman and Aliabadian 2013</xref>). Therefore, our results support the view that the Common Barn Owl shows strong genetic differentiation across its geographic range, in particular among populations from distant geographic areas.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Short-eared Owl, the intraspecific divergence of 3.1% is in accordance with previous studies that also used the <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> gene, which reported a maximum divergence of 3.3% for the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Nijman and Aliabadian 2013</xref>) or a mean distance of 3.2% between a single specimen from Argentina and multiple specimens <!--PageBreak-->from North America, Europe and northern Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Kerr et al. 2009</xref>). The divergence between Short-eared Owls from (southern) South America and those sampled elsewhere is interesting and indicates that the taxonomic status of South American populations requires detailed taxonomic study. Again, this should include multiple lines of evidence, including morphology and acoustics, in addition to molecular data.</p>
            <p>The levels of sequence variation observed for the Common Barn Owls and the Short-eared Owl from Chile compared to those from other continents was well above the mean intraspecific distance reported for bird species, which ranges from 0.23% to 0.43% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aliabadian et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hebert et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kerr et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>). These values are higher than any other owl species analysed so far using <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequence data, given that in these it has been reported a value of average distance less than 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Nijman and Aliabadian 2013</xref>).</p>
            <p>In previous studies, high levels of sequence divergence have often been interpreted as a possible taxonomic artifact, i.e. as an indication that more taxonomic study is warranted. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hebert et al. (2004)</xref> found four out of 260 species of North American birds with intraspecific divergence ranging from 3.7 to 7.2%, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Kerr et al. (2009)</xref>, studying the birds of Argentina, observed 13 out of 389 species with sequence divergences exceeding 2.4%. In birds, disjunct ranges, differences in ecology, non-migratory behaviour and rapid speciation may be important factors associated with this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Kerr et al. 2009</xref>). In the case of the Common Barn Owl, the existence of geographic barriers to gene flow among populations on different continents is to be expected, and this in combination with its non-migratory or short-distance migratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Matics 2003</xref>), should contribute to promote the genetic divergence. However, all New World Common Barn Owls studied in this work were very similar given that no major genetic divergences were observed. This result agrees with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Nijman and Aliabadian (2013)</xref>, who found no latitudinal clusters for Common Barn Owl sequences from different places of America (North America, the Caribbean, northern South America and southern South America). Although further analysis with other molecular markers is needed to support this result; even so, it is likely that the scarce genetic variation of the Common Barn Owl registered across America may reflect the existence of a particular process of divergence.</p>
            <p>In conclusion this study provides further evidence that the Common Barn Owl and the Short-eared Owl show high levels of intraspecific <abbrev xlink:title="mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I">COI</abbrev> sequence divergence across their geographic range. The level of genetic differentiation of both species collected in South America was above the upper limit of species reported for <tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="order">Strigiformes</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name>, suggesting that further studies are needed to evaluate the taxonomic position of these populations.</p>
