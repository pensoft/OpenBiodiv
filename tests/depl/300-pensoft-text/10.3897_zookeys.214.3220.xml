The incidental nature of this discovery is underscored by the fact that the species was initially photographed and then released, with images subsequently posted to an online image database. It was not until the images in the database were randomly examined by the professional taxonomists that it was determined that the species was in fact new. A subsequent specimen was collected at the same locality and is described herein along with another specimen identified from nearby Sabah.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>New species are increasingly being discovered by the general public with interests in the natural sciences long before they are recognized as new to science by professional taxonomists and formally described. With the rapid development of digital photographic technology, professional and amateur photographers are unknowingly discovering and informally documenting new species of animals and plants by placing images of them in online image databases long before taxonomists can examine them. In some cases the specimen is not collected, so this discovery is effervescent until additional specimens can be subsequently vouchered to enable type designation during the formal descriptive process. Herein we document one such case involving a distinctive new green lacewing (<tp:taxon-name>Neuroptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Chrysopidae</tp:taxon-name>) species from Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Green lacewings are the second largest family of lacewings, with more than 1200 species in approximately 80 valid genera distributed in all major biogeographical regions worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks and Barnard 1990</xref>). Three subfamilies are recognized although number of species in the subfamilies <tp:taxon-name>Apochrysinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Nothochrysinae</tp:taxon-name> comprise a relatively minor component of the world fauna. <tp:taxon-name>Apochrysinae</tp:taxon-name> are represented by six pantropical genera of spectacularly large and delicate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Kimmins 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Winterton and Brooks 2002</xref>). <tp:taxon-name>Nothochrysinae</tp:taxon-name> are represented by nine genera world wide, and contain many species that exhibit putative ancestral characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Adams 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks and Barnard 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Adams and Penny 1992</xref>). The overwhelming majority of the generic and species-level diversity belongs to <tp:taxon-name>Chrysopinae</tp:taxon-name>, with approximately 97% of all living species. This subfamily is further divided into four tribes: <tp:taxon-name>Belonopterygini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Chrysopini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Leucochrysini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Ankylopterygini</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks and Barnard 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Winterton and de Freitas 2006</xref>). <tp:taxon-name>Ankylopterygini</tp:taxon-name> are a Palaeotropical group thoroughly characterized recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brooks (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1986</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks and Barnard (1990)</xref> and differentiated from other tribes based on the close proximity of veins Sc and R, narrow mandibles lacking internal teeth, and elongation and apical narrowing of the labial and maxillary palpi.  The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa</tp:taxon-name></italic> Brooks, 1983 contains 14 previously described species from Japan southwards through the Oriental and Australasian regions to Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brooks 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1986</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa</tp:taxon-name></italic> is differentiated from other <tp:taxon-name>Ankylopterygini</tp:taxon-name> genera by the presence of distinct markings (i.e. two or three spots) on the frons, cell <italic>im</italic> present, forewing with an elongate stigma with 3–4 Sc-R crossveins, and male genitalia with two pairs of gonosetae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks and Barnard 1990</xref>). A new and distinctive species is described here (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa jade</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.) based on two female specimens from Malaysia.</p>
            <p>The discovery of a new species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa</tp:taxon-name></italic> described in this paper is a direct result of the incidental interaction of photographer/citizen scientist, online image database and professional scientists. Images of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa jade</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">–3</xref>) were initially posted by the second author (GHP) on the online image database Flickr ® for comment by the photography and natural history communities. The specimen had been released once it was photographed and at this stage no determination had been made on the taxonomic identity of the species. The online images were then<!--PageBreak--> randomly examined by the senior author (SLW) who determined that this distinctive species was not immediately recognizable as any previously described species. Links to the images were forwarded to additional experts in chrysopid taxonomy to elicit comment on its possible taxonomic identity. After extensive discussion it was concluded that the species was likely new to science but its generic placement inconclusive based solely upon the images at hand. The senior author contacted the photographer and an additional specimen to was collected a year later at the same locality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This second specimen was photographed and sent to the senior author for examination and subsequent formal description as a new species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa</tp:taxon-name></italic>. An additional female specimen from Sabah was also located in the entomology collection of the Natural History Museum, London. The manuscript was prepared by the authors based on a cybertaxonomy model using internet cloud based technology (i.e. Google™ Document), while images were archived in Encyclopedia of Life and Morphbank image databases and new taxonomic acts registered in Zoobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Pyle and Michel 2008</xref>).</p>

Genitalia were macerated in 10% KOH to remove soft tissue, then rinsed in distilled water and dilute glacial acetic acid, and dissected in 80% ethanol and subsequently stained with a saturated solution of Chlorazol Black in 40% ethanol. Genitalia preparations were placed in glycerine in a genitalia vial mounted on the pin beneath the specimen.</p>

                    <p>The unusual new species is easily differentiated from all other species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the distinctive wing venation mark between the antennal bases and only two spots across the frons, as well as the female abdominal sternite 7 being posteromedially acuminate with a tuft of strong setae. Only the female is known at this stage. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa jade</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. is similar in appearance to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa wallacei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, based on head and wing markings. Like <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa jade</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Semachrysa wallacei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is also only known from the female.</p>
