                <p>Four New World species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Zeller are described from serpentine mines in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Family <tp:taxon-name>Lauraceae</tp:taxon-name>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis hyperpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic>,new species, mines the upper leaf surfaces of avocado, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea americana</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mill., and red bay, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea borbonia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (L.) Spreng. and ranges over much of the southeastern United States into Central America. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis subpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic>,new species, mines the underside and occasionally upper sides of new leaves of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea borbonia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in southeastern United States<italic>. Phyllocnistis longipalpa</italic>, new species, known only from southern Florida also mines the undersides of new leaves of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea borbonia</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis perseafolia</tp:taxon-name></italic>,new species, mines both leaf surfaces and possibly fruits of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea americana</tp:taxon-name></italic> in Colombia, South America. As in all known species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the early instars are subepidermal sapfeeders in young (not fully hardened) foliage, and the final instar is an extremely specialized, nonfeeding larval form, whose primary function is to spin the silken cocoon, at the mine terminus, prior to pupation. Early stages are illustrated and described for three of the species. The unusual morphology of the pupae, particularly the frontal process of the head, is shown to be one of the most useful morphological sources of diagnostic characters for species identification of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. COI barcode sequence distances are provided for the four proposed species and a fifth, undescribed species from Costa Rica.</p>

        <sec sec-type="Introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Although the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Zeller, 1848 is one of the more speciose genera in the <tp:taxon-name>Gracillariidae</tp:taxon-name>, its diversity is greatly underestimated in existing taxonomic literature. Currently 90 valid names are known for the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">DePrins and Kawahara 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">De Prins and De Prins 2011</xref>), with 28 listed for the New World (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Davis and Miller 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kawahara et al. 2009</xref>). During 1996 – 1998, as part of the Arthropods of La Selva (ALAS) Project, the authors conducted a preliminary survey of the <tp:taxon-name>Gracillariidae</tp:taxon-name> of La Selva Biological Station, a lowland rain forest site in northwestern Costa Rica. Because our visits to the study site were limited to less than 15 days each year, our survey was restricted largely to the collection of leafmines and examination of plant specimens in the station’s herbarium. Relying primarily on mine morphology and host plant information, we estimated that as many as 200 species of <tp:taxon-name>Gracillariidae</tp:taxon-name> were present at La Selva Biological Station. By far the most speciose genus in our survey was <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> with an estimated 60 species, of which we recognized only a single previously known species, the invasive citrus leafminer, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis citrella</tp:taxon-name></italic> Stainton. Interestingly, this globally monitored species had been first reported in the Americas (Florida and the West Indies) only three years earlier in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Heppner 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hoy and Nguyen 1997</xref>). Further, we believe it probable that several more <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic>-feeding <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> will be found considering that there are more than 200 species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic> known globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Mabberley 2008</xref>), and that as many as three species may use a single host species at a single location: e.g., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea borbonia</tp:taxon-name></italic> at Pa-hay-okee Overlook in the Florida Everglades. Although only four species are proposed in this report, a fifth species based on COI barcode sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and unique pupal characters (but without properly associated adults) has been examined from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea americana</tp:taxon-name></italic> collected in Costa Rica. While preliminary, our studies suggest that tropical diversity of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> will someday tally in the hundreds of species.</p>

            <p>Adults of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are very small moths with wing spans generally not exceeding 5 mm. Both fore- and hindwings are lanceolate and predominantly white; the forewings are marked with yellow to orange, longitudinal and oblique striae, often bordered by gray or black (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A–D</xref>). A few species are known to possess much darker or strikingly color patterns. Terminology used for describing forewing pattern follows that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kawahara et al. (2009)</xref>. The compound eyes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are reduced, with an interocular index (vertical eye diameter/minimum interocular distance) of approximately 0.9. The maxillary palpi are the most reduced among <tp:taxon-name>Gracillariidae</tp:taxon-name>, being barely evident as vestigial, non-segmented lobes at the base of the elongate proboscis. The wing venation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Forbes 1923</xref>) is also reduced with M1 stalked to Rs4; M3 and<!--PageBreak--> CuA2 are lost in the forewing; the base of M is absent within the forewing discal cell, and the cell is open in the hindwing. The apex of the forewing is unusual in being greatly attenuated with Rs4 extending to the apex.</p>
            <p>The morphology of the male genitalia is relatively simple and usually characterized by a relatively broad vinculum, narrow tegumen and slender valvae, and species-level differences are modest relative to other gracillariids or <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> in general. Homology of what appears to be segment 10 is uncertain and consists of a mostly membranous cylinder extending caudally from the sclerotized tegumen that mostly encompasses the anal tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Fig. 16A</xref>).</p>
            <p>The female genitalia, although characteristic for the genus, likewise appears relatively uniform among species, consisting primarily of very short papillae anales, a comparatively large, oblong corpus bursae often containing a pair of similar, fusiform signa bearing a short median projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Fig. 16D</xref>); a pair of similar, slender, elongate ducts that extend from usually opposite ends of the corpus bursae, one (ductus bursae) leading to the ostium and the other (ductus spermathecae) to the spermatheca.</p>
            <p>The larvae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are among the most specialized <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Trägårdh 1913</xref>). Four instars appear to be the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Condrashoff 1962</xref>, Wagner and Davis unpublished data), with the first three instars possessing a sapfeeding morphology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Davis 1987</xref>). Sapfeeding instars create a long serpentine, subepidermal mine on either the upper or lower surfaces of the host leaf. A few species also form subepi<!--PageBreak-->dermal mines on stems and various fruits, including avocado. A characteristic, median frass trail extends the length of the mine, usually as a dark, unbroken line. The fourth instar is a highly specialized, apodal, non-feeding instar whose primary function is to spin the cocoon, at the mine terminus, prior to pupation.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conservative morphology of the larval and adult stages, the pupae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are structurally diverse, particularly with regard to the development of the frontal process (cocoon-cutter) of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14A, B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kawahara et al. 2009</xref>). In addition, the mid-dorsal areas of abdominal terga 3–7 possess a mostly symmetrical cluster of recurved spines that frequently differ in their arrangement and form among species. Given the uniformity in both male and female genital characters in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, it is surprising to us to find reliable species-level differences in pupal morphology across what appear to be closely-related congeners feeding on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic>. We certainly encourage others to collect and illustrate pupae whenever new species are described in the genus.</p>
            <p>Consistent differences in wing patterns were noted for each of the four species described here—although such are easily abraded if specimens are not collected and prepared with care. We note that our descriptions are based solely on reared material and thus might differ in appearance from flown specimens. Because of the general similarity of both male and female genitalia that exists among most members of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, species identification relying upon standard genitalic characters may be impossible at times. We expect that the application of COI barcoding will be especially useful in this large genus of minute moths.</p>
            <p>The plant genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic> includes approximately 200 species worldwide, with a majority of the species concentrated in Central America and southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Mabberley 2008</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kopp (1966)</xref> recognized 81 species for the New World. The most important species economically is the avocado, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea americana</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mill., which is grown throughout the tropics for its fruit.</p>
            <p>Half of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> found in eastern North America are hostplant specialists on archaic families of woody plants: 3 species feed on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the <tp:taxon-name>Lauraceae</tp:taxon-name>, 2 on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Magnolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Liriodendron</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the <tp:taxon-name>Magnoliaceae</tp:taxon-name>, and 1 on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Liquidambar</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the <tp:taxon-name>Hamamelidaceae</tp:taxon-name> (or <tp:taxon-name>Altingaceae</tp:taxon-name>), all plant families that date to the Cretaceous. Ninety seven-million-year-old (more recently estimated at 102 mya, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Brenner et al. 2000</xref>) phyllocnistine leafmines provide the oldest fossil evidence of Ditrysian <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Labandeira et al. 1994</xref>). Phylogenetic studies will be needed to ascertain if the association of the genus with archaic plant families is a testament to the ancient and often conservative nature of insect-plant associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Farrell et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Labandeira et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Wilf et al. 2000</xref>) or the result of more recent host colonizations.</p>
            <p>The damage inflicted by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> larvae feeding on avocado may vary according to region and the species of miner involved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Wysoki et al. (2002)</xref> reported major damage to avocado caused by an unknown <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in Peru that could reduce tree vigor,but only minor damage on avocado by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in Florida. Larval feeding by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis perseafolia</tp:taxon-name></italic><!--PageBreak--> on avocado leaves in Colombia is known to cause serious damage (Francisco Posada, <italic>in litt</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Possibly the damage to avocado in Peru reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Wysoki et al. (2002)</xref> was also produced by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis perseafolia</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

            <p>Collecting and rearing.Nearly all of the adults in this study were reared from their plant hosts. Leaves containing mines with larvae were placed in plastic bags or large plastic tubes and examined daily thereafter. Newly-eclosed adults were killed with ammonium hydroxide fumes or frozen, pinned, and spread. Some larvae representing different instars and pupae were fixed in Pampel fluid and preserved in 75% ethanol. Samples of alcohol-preserved larvae and pupae were gently washed in 409® detergent, then dried in a critical point drier, sputter coated with 20–25 gold palladium 60:40 alloy, and photographed with an Amray 1810 scanning electron microscope.</p>
            <p>Genitalic dissections were cleared by heating in hot 10% KOH for ~ 30 minutes, and subsequently cleaned and stained with either 2% chlorazol black E or mercurochrome solutions. All genitalic illustrations were drawn from dissections temporarily stored in glycerine, which were later permanently embedded in Euparal or Canada balsam. Genitalic terminology follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Klots (1970)</xref>.</p>
            <p>Molecular analysis.DNA <bold>s</bold>equences were produced at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph, Canada. DNA was extracted from legs or entire bodies of adult moths using a QIAGEN DNeasy Tissue Kit. Primers LepF1 and LepR1 (Herbert et al. 2004) were used to obtain a 658 base pair fragment of COI with a standard thermocycling regime (Hajibabaei et al. 2006). Sequences are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database and at the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were generated from 14 nucleotide sequences as implemented in BOLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ratnasingham and Hebert </xref>2007).</p>

The second costal fascia is weakly developed and does not fuse with the transverse fascia as in other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> treated here. Hind tarsomere 3 is more likely to be black than that of the other species. The black fringe scales about the tornus are less conspicuous: fewer in number, narrower, and less blackened relative to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis subpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic> with which it commonly co-occurs. The frontal process of the pupa extends forward as a relatively large, broadly triangular, acute spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6A–B</xref>).</p>

                        <p> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>): A long, slender, serpentine gallery, with a relatively broad, dark brownish, median frass trail, almost always located on the upper (adaxial) side of the leaf (only 1 under (abaxial) side mine found). The egg is deposited on the upper leaf surface away from the midrib. Mine begins on one side of the blade, but after much of one side is consumed, crosses over near the leaf apex to the other side. The median frass line is unusually broad for a species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, resembling more that of the Chilean genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Prophyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Davis 1994</xref>). As previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Davis 1994</xref>), <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->the mines of <italic>hyperpersea</italic> are also similar in general morphology to early Cenomanian phyllocnistine leafmines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Labandeira et al. 1994</xref>). Pupation occurs in the lamina, away from the leaf edge (~ 5–7 mm in diameter) in a circular nidus, similar to that fashioned by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Prophyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The serpentine portion of the mine begins as a narrow tract ~ 0.3 mm wide and gradually enlarges before the pupation chamber to a width of ~ 2–2.5 mm. The median frass line is ¼ of the mine width in the early instars and gradually broadens to more than half the mine width.</p>

                        <p><bold>Distribution</bold>: This species has been found from Nansemond and Virginia Beach Counties, Virginia, USA, south along the lowland Atlantic coastal region to the Florida Everglades. Adults in the collections of the USNM, from avocado, some with associated mines and collected at various localities in Honduras, may also represent this species. No pupae were available for study and attempts to barcode two specimens were unsuccessful. Mines with associated pupae of what appear to be <italic>hyperpersea</italic> have also been intercepted on shipments of avocado within the United States from unspecified localities in Mexico. Some fluctuation in the northern limits of this leafminer may have occurred in recent years. As late as June 8–11, 1974, DRD and Mignon Davis found mines of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis hypersersea</tp:taxon-name></italic> common on leaves of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea borbonia</tp:taxon-name></italic> within First Landing State Park and Dismal Swamp, Virginia. On March 14, 1992 and during August 1993 no mines could be found at First Landing State Park (Dismal Swamp was not visited in 1993). These localities have not been surveyed for leafminers since 1993.</p>
                        <p><bold>Etymology</bold>: The specific name is derived from the Greek, <italic>hyper</italic> (above, over) and the generic plant name of its host, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic>, in reference to the characteristic leafmining habit of the larva on the upperside of the leaf.

The apical dot tends to be poorly developed. It is the only <italic><tp:taxon-name>Persea</tp:taxon-name></italic> feeder that consistently has a subbasal fuscous spot along the inner margin of the forewing (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis hyperpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic> sometimes has fuscous scales in the subbasal area of the forewing, but these do not form a spot but rather extend as a diffuse patch to the wing base). The hind tarsomeres (especially segments 2–3) often bear orange to fuscous scaling that is somewhat more pronounced than that of the species that follow. The ductus bursae is broadly joined to corpus bursae.

The well-developed black apical dot distinguishes <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis perseafolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> from<!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--> all but <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis hyperpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The forewing is the palest of the four <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic> described here: the black scaling--in the subbasal and tornal areas, as well as that which edges the longitudinal and transverse fascia--is reduced relative to the other species described here. The transverse fascia is often interrupted through the center of the forewing because the arms are so strongly angled outward that they may not meet; likewise the longitudinal fascia frequently does not join the transverse fascia in <italic>persaefolia</italic> for the same reason.</p>

Transverse fascia edged inwardly and outwardly with black scales; upper arm leaving costal margin at 30–35° angle, with distal reach curving toward apical dot; often interrupted through cell; arm of transverse fasciae from inner margin more strongly edged with black along outer edge; proximal edge of fascia where it leaves the inner margin vague, with faint dark scaling. Second costal fascia ill-defined, with little black scaling, sometimes conjoined with transverse fascia. Three costal and three apical strigulae modestly differentiated. Apical spot well developed.

            <p>We wish to thank several individuals who have assisted our work by providing critical information, loans of specimens under their care, or for other special assistance: Francisco Javier Posada, Laurel, Maryland generously provided specimens of the new species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis perseafolia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, for study as well as images of the leafmines; John Heppner, Florida State Collection of Arthropods, Gainesville, Florida provided specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis hyperpersea</tp:taxon-name></italic><!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--> reared from avocado; Jorge Peña, University of Florida, Homestead, Florida provided information on the pest status of certain <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllocnistis</tp:taxon-name></italic>; and Mignon Davis assisted with fieldwork in Florida, in data recording, and curation of reared material. For collecting permits in protected areas of southern Florida and other assistance, we are indebted to Renata Skinner, Jeanne Parks, and staff of the Division of Recreation and Parks, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Key Largo, Florida; Ben Kohl of the Big Cypress National Wildlife Preserve, Ochopee, Florida; and Roger Hammer, formerly of Castellow Hammock Park, Redland, Florida. We thank DRD research assistant Patricia Gentili Poole and illustrators Vichai Malikul and Young Sohn of the Department of Entomology, Smithsonian Institution for their graphics assistance and line illustrations respectively; the color illustrations were by V. Malikul. P. Gentili Poole and DRD, assisted by Scott Whittaker, manager of the Natural History Museum SEM lab, are responsible for the SEM images. The <tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name> parasitoids were identified by Michael Gates of the Systematic Entomology Laboratory, USDA, Washington, D.C. The DNA barcode sequences were generated at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario with funding to Paul D.N. Hebert from Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute, NSERC, and the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation. We would also like to acknowledge the support for fieldwork on <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> leafminers in Costa Rica provided by the ALAS (Arthropods of La Selva) III project (funded by National Science Foundation grants DEB-9706976, DEB-0072702) and co-principal investigator John Longino. We are also grateful for the assistance provided by the parataxonomists at the La Selva Biological Station formerly working on this project, Danilo Brenes, Flor Cascante, Nelci Oconitrillo, Maylin Paniagua, and Ronald Vargas.</p>
